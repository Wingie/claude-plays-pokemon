# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a comprehensive AI-powered Pokemon gaming project that uses **multi-provider LLM AI** (Google Gemini + Mistral AI) to automatically play Pokemon games through multiple emulator interfaces. The project combines multimodal AI reasoning, real-time game control, advanced emulation technology, and **centralized LLM API system** with **standardized JSON responses** to create intelligent Pokemon-playing agents with provider flexibility, error resilience, and consistent parsing.

## Project Concerns and Warnings

- **Avoiding Hard-Coded Logic**: There is concern about hard-coded navigation logic that needs to be removed
- **AI System Design Philosophy**: The system should press buttons based on AI (Mixtral or Gemini) results without additional helper logic
- **Navigation Enhancement Critique**: Current navigation approaches may be too prescriptive and need to be more generalized
