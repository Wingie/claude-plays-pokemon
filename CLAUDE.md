## Repository Overview

This is a comprehensive AI-powered Pokemon gaming project that uses Google Gemini AI to automatically play Pokemon games through multiple emulator interfaces. The project combines multimodal AI reasoning, real-time game control, and advanced emulation technology to create intelligent Pokemon-playing agents.

## Project Structure

### Core Components

- **Eevee v1**: Advanced AI task execution system with natural language interface (`eevee/`)
- **VideoGameBench Integration**: Comprehensive VLM evaluation framework for game benchmarking
- **SkyEmu MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol server for advanced Game Boy Advance emulation
- **Gemini Multimodal Playground**: Experimental AI features with RL integration

### Key Entry Points
- `run_step_gemini.py`: legacy Pokemon controller using mGBA emulator
- `eevee/run_eevee.py`: Eevee v1 AI task execution system - OUR VERSINO
- `videogamebench/main.py`: legacy game evaluation framework
- `skyemu-mcp/run_server.py`: MCP server for SkyEmu integration
- `test_setup.py`: Environment validation and setup verification

## Development Commands

```

## Architecture Overview

### Multi-Layer Architecture
The project uses a layered approach:
1. **AI Decision Layer**: Gemini API for strategic reasoning and task decomposition
2. **Task Execution Layer**: Eevee v1 system for natural language task execution
3. **Control Layer**: Platform-specific input simulation (PyAutoGUI + macOS Quartz, SkyEmu HTTP API)
4. **Emulation Layer**: Multiple emulators (mGBA, SkyEmu, PyBoy)
5. **Integration Layer**: REST APIs and MCP protocols for advanced control
6. **Memory Layer**: Persistent context and session management (SQLite)

### Key Design Patterns
- **Controller Pattern**: Separate emulator controllers with unified interfaces
- **Strategy Pattern**: Swappable AI agents (RL, LLM, Hybrid)
- **Adapter Pattern**: Unified LLM interface across providers
- **Observer Pattern**: Game state monitoring and progress tracking

### Platform-Specific Integration (macOS)
- Native **Quartz framework** for window management and screen capture
- **PyObjC** for Objective-C bridge functionality
- Optimized for **Apple Silicon** and **Core Graphics**
- Requires accessibility permissions for input simulation

## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Python 3.8+** (3.10+ for VideoGameBench)
- **Google Gemini API** for multimodal AI reasoning
- **PyAutoGUI** + **macOS Quartz** for input simulation
- **PIL/Pillow** for image processing and screenshot management
- **LiteLLM** for unified LLM API access
- **FastAPI** for REST API development
- **PyTorch** for RL agent implementation

### Emulation Platforms
- **mGBA**: Game Boy/Game Boy Color emulation
- **SkyEmu**: Game Boy Advance emulation with HTTP control
- **PyBoy**: Python Game Boy emulator (in VideoGameBench)
- **JS-DOS**: DOS game emulation (in VideoGameBench)

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for all AI functionality
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Create .env file or set in environment
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key" > .env
```

### Game Configuration
- **VideoGameBench configs**: YAML files in `videogamebench/configs/`
- **ROM management**: Place game ROMs in `videogamebench/roms/`
- **Save states**: Managed in project root and `videogamebench/saves/`

## Development Workflow

### Standard Development Process
1. **Setup**: Run `./setup.sh` and `python test_setup.py`
2. **Development**: Modify code with attention to emulator compatibility
3. **Testing**: Test with actual emulators and game ROMs
4. **Integration**: Verify cross-component compatibility

### Code Style and Conventions
- **PascalCase** for classes (`PokemonController`, `GeminiAPI`)
- **snake_case** for functions and files (`press_button`, `capture_screen`)
- **Google-style docstrings** for documentation
- **Type hints** used consistently throughout
- **Error handling** with graceful degradation and informative messages

### Testing Approach
- **Environment validation**: Use `test_setup.py` to verify setup
- **Integration testing**: Real emulator testing with actual Pokemon games
- **Platform testing**: macOS-specific window management and screen capture
- **API testing**: Gemini API connectivity and response handling

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New Games
1. Add ROM mapping in `videogamebench/src/consts.py`
2. Create game config in `videogamebench/configs/[game]/`
3. Add game-specific prompts and settings
4. Test with target emulator platform

### Extending AI Capabilities
1. Modify prompts in game configs or main controller
2. Update action parsing in `gemini_api.py`
3. Test AI decision-making with various game scenarios
4. Monitor API costs and response quality

### Platform Integration
1. Ensure macOS Quartz integration for screen capture
2. Test window finding and focus functionality
3. Verify accessibility permissions are sufficient
4. Handle platform-specific edge cases

## Important Notes

### Security and Privacy
- **Never commit API keys** - use `.env` files (gitignored)
- **ROM files excluded** - users must provide their own legally-owned games
- **Save files protected** - personal game progress excluded from repository

### Performance Considerations
- **Screenshot optimization**: JPEG compression for AI processing
- **API rate limiting**: Intelligent delays and caching for Gemini calls
- **Memory management**: Cleanup of temporary screenshots and game states
- **Real-time constraints**: Fast response times for smooth gameplay

### macOS-Specific Requirements
- **Accessibility permissions** required for input simulation
- **Screen recording permissions** needed for screenshot capture
- **PyObjC dependencies** for native API access
- **Homebrew recommended** for dependency management

### No Automated Linting
The project does not use automated linting or formatting tools. Code quality is maintained through manual review, comprehensive testing, and adherence to documented conventions.
