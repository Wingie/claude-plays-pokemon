This notebook shows how to fine-tune [PaliGemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/paligemma) on a vision-language task with [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). *Fine-tuning* is a process that can improve your model's performance on specific tasks or help the model adhere to specific output requirements when instructions aren't sufficient and you have a set of examples that demonstrate the outputs you want. Gemma-based models like PaliGemma require fine-tuning to produce expected results.

### What's in this notebook

This notebook uses the model reference implementation from [`big_vision`](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision)
and shows how to:

 * Install dependencies, and download the PaliGemma model checkpoint and training data
 * Load the model onto GPU devices
 * Prepare the model's inputs for training and inference
 * Fine-tune the model
 * Inspect the output

The training data for this notebook consists of 90 pairs of images and long captions describing them. To make it runnable on a T4 colab runtime, you'll only fine-tune the attention layers of the language model and freeze the other parameters.

This example is for learning purposes only. In a real use case, the amount of data, trainable parameters, training steps and hyper-parameters, and obtained results could be significantly different.

### Before you begin

Before going through this notebook, you should be familiar with Python code, as well as how large language models (LLMs) are trained. You don't need to be familiar with JAX, but basic knowledge about JAX (or similar technologies such as Keras) is helpful when reading through the example code.

## Setup

The following sections explain the preliminary steps for getting a notebook to use a PaliGemma model, including model access, getting an API key, and configuring the notebook runtime.

### Get access to PaliGemma

Before using PaliGemma for the first time, you must request access to the model through Kaggle by completing the following steps:

1. Log in to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), or create a new Kaggle account if you don't already have one.
1. Go to the [PaliGemma model card](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/paligemma-2) and click **Request Access**.
1. Complete the consent form and accept the terms and conditions.

### Configure your API key

To use PaliGemma, you must provide your Kaggle username and a Kaggle API key.

To generate a Kaggle API key, open your [**Settings** page in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/settings) and click **Create New Token**. This triggers the download of a `kaggle.json` file containing your API credentials.

Then, in Colab, select **Secrets** (ðŸ”‘) in the left pane and add your Kaggle username and Kaggle API key. Store your username under the name `KAGGLE_USERNAME` and your API key under the name `KAGGLE_KEY`.

### Select the runtime

To complete this tutorial, you'll need to have a Colab runtime with sufficient resources to run the PaliGemma model. In this case, you can use a T4 GPU:

1. In the upper-right of the Colab window, click the **â–¾ (Additional connection options)** dropdown menu.
1. Select **Change runtime type**.
1. Under **Hardware accelerator**, select **T4 GPU**.

### Set environment variables

Set the environment variables for `KAGGLE_USERNAME` and `KAGGLE_KEY`.

PaliGemma includes several model variations. For this tutorial, you'll use the base [JAX/FLAX PaliGemma 3B weight model](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/paligemma-2/jax/paligemma2-3b-pt-224).

"""### Configure the model

It's time to actually start configuring the model that you're going to use.

For this notebook, you need to be able to fit your model onto a T4 GPU. Having a limited resource like space constraints means that you have to be mindful of how your model is configured.

If you fine-tune every parameter, your model won't be able to run in the notebook environment. As a result, in this part of the notebook, you'll configure your model so that it has the ability to freeze some of the parameters, and only fine-tune the parameters that really need to be fine-tuned for the model to give you accurate results. In LLMs, parameters are said to be *frozen* when they are no longer actively being used to train the model.

In order to configure your model, you need to:

* Initialize the `model_config` as a [`FrozenConfigDict`](https://github.com/google/ml_collections/tree/master#frozenconfigdict) so that you can freeze some of the parameters and keep memory usage low
* Initialize an instance of the PaliGemma `Model` class using the `model_config` as its configurations
* Load the model parameters into RAM
* Define a `decode` function to sample outputs from the model

This code in this cell takes about a minute to run to completion.

This process takes longer than loading them simultaneously, but it requires more RAM than you have available in this notebook.

Finally, print out all of the parameters to see what type each individual parameter is cast to. Frozen parameters are kept as `float16`, while the trainable parameters are cast to `float32`. When you inspect the list, you'll see that most of the parameters have been frozen and are `float16`.

Now that your model is configured, you can tune it. In this step, you'll create your model's inputs as well as the training and validation iterators, view the training examples, and define the training and validation loops.

### Create model inputs

The model checkpoint you're using has already been trained on images of various aspect ratios that have been resized to 224x224 pixels, and to handle tokenized texts.

The code below defines three functions that you'll use in the next step create the model's inputs:

* **`preprocess_image`:** Normalizes the image data. In this case, pre-processing converts the passed-in image to greyscale, removes the alpha layer, and resizes the passed-in image to the size required by the model for image inputs (224x224 pixels).
* **`preprocess_tokens`:** Splits the tokens up and adds flags to mark whether a token is a prefix or suffix token. These flags will be used later on in the code, during the training step and the evaluation loop.
* **`postprocess_tokens`:** Removes any tokens left at and/or after the end-of-sequence (EOS) token and returns the remaining decoded tokens.

"""### Define the training and evaluation loops

Define the training loop to train the model on the provided dataset, and the evaluation loop to look at all of the examples in the validation dataset and make its predictions.

#### Defining the training loop

The `update_fn` function defines the training step. During the training step, the loss per example is calculated and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is applied to the trainable parameters.

Recall that earlier in the notebook, you included flags in the `preprocess_tokens` function that included `mask_loss`. You'll use the `mask_loss` flag here to exclude prefix and padded tokens from the loss. Without it, the loss calculation will be skewed. You also need to normalize each example, since each of them has a different number of tokens. After the prefix and padded tokens have been excluded and the examples have been normalized, you can calculate the loss per example.

The training step also includes a function to apply an SGD to optimize the training.

#### Defining the evaluation loop

The `make_predictions` function is your evaluation loop. The evaluation loop is fairly straight forward with one notable change. If you recall from the beginning of the notebook, you only have 90 examples in your training data set. This is a very small amount of training examples, and your model ends up not having enough examples for the batch size when you run the training. This means that in the evaluation loop, you need to pad the batch by repeating examples.

To make sure that your evaluation loop only counts actual examples and not the padded examples, you have to apply a mask to the padded examples that excludes them from the output.

Every 16 steps, the model prints what its predictions are at that step in the training. This code prints out predictions for the same set of images so that you can see the model's ability to predict descriptions improve over time.

At earlier steps in the training, there's likely issues with the descriptions, such as repeated sentences as the model gets stuck in its predictive loop or unfinished sentences. The model's predictions become steadily more accurate as training progresses. By step 64, the model's predictions should closely resemble the descriptions provided by the training data.

This process takes around 15 minutes to complete on T4 TPUs.

"""## Output

The validation data for this notebook consists of just 10 images. In normal code, you would likely have many more data points for validation, but for this notebook, run the following code to generate descriptions for all 10 images. After tuning the model, these descriptions should be very similar in form and content coverage to the descriptions included with the training data that you looked at earlier in this notebook.

Run the below code to generate descriptions for the validation data set.
