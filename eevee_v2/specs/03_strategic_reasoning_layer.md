## Key Deliverables

### 1. Griffin SSM Strategic Reasoning Core
**Requirement**: Constant memory strategic reasoning with pause-based planning

**Architecture Specifications**:
```python
class StrategicReasoningCore:
    def __init__(self):
        # Griffin-inspired SSM with constant memory
        self.strategic_ssm = GriffinSSM(
            hidden_size=512,
            recurrent_layers=2,      # Gated Linear Recurrent Units
            attention_window=2048,   # ~30 seconds of game context
            memory_footprint='constant'  # Key constraint
        )
        
        # Strategic planning components
        self.goal_decomposer = HierarchicalGoalDecomposer()
        self.plan_generator = MultiStepPlanGenerator()
        self.reward_estimator = OutcomePredictor()
        
    def generate_strategic_plan(self, game_state, uncertainty_context):
        # Pause-based reasoning (unlimited time)
        with self.pause_game_execution():
            # Analyze current situation with full context
            situation_analysis = self.analyze_strategic_situation(game_state)
            
            # Generate multiple strategic options
            strategic_options = self.generate_strategic_options(situation_analysis)
            
            # Evaluate options using learned reward function
            evaluated_options = self.evaluate_strategic_options(strategic_options)
            
            # Select best strategy and create execution plan
            best_strategy = self.select_optimal_strategy(evaluated_options)
            execution_plan = self.create_execution_plan(best_strategy)
            
            return execution_plan
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Strategic planning completes within 5 seconds for 95% of decisions
- Memory usage remains constant regardless of session length
- Strategic plans achieve >90% task completion when executed
- Strategic coherence maintained over 10+ minute gameplay sessions

### 2. Goal Decomposition and Planning System
**Requirement**: Break down high-level objectives into executable sub-goals

**Hierarchical Planning Structure**:
```python
@dataclass
class PokemonGoal:
    goal_id: str
    goal_type: str          # "navigate", "battle", "collect", "evolve"
    description: str
    priority: int           # 1-10 scale
    prerequisites: List[str]
    success_criteria: Dict[str, Any]
    estimated_duration: int  # frames
    subgoals: List['PokemonGoal']
    
class GoalDecomposer:
    def decompose_goal(self, high_level_goal: str, current_state: GameState):
        # Example: "Become Pokemon Champion" -> subgoals
        goal_tree = self.build_goal_tree(high_level_goal)
        
        # Filter achievable goals based on current state
        achievable_goals = self.filter_by_current_state(goal_tree, current_state)
        
        # Prioritize based on strategic context
        prioritized_goals = self.prioritize_goals(achievable_goals, current_state)
        
        return prioritized_goals
```

**Planning Examples**:
- **"Get to Pokemon Center"** → [Navigate to Route X, Avoid tall grass, Enter building]
- **"Win Gym Battle"** → [Assess team strength, Train if needed, Challenge leader]
- **"Catch specific Pokemon"** → [Navigate to habitat, Find Pokemon, Weaken and catch]

**Success Criteria**:
- Goal decomposition completes in <1 second
- 95% of generated subgoals are valid and achievable
- Strategic plans show clear logical progression
- Goal hierarchy maintains coherence across planning sessions

### 3. Memory Integration with Neo4j Strategic Knowledge
**Requirement**: Graph-based strategic knowledge with semantic search

```cypher
// Core entities
CREATE (location:Location {name: "Viridian City", region: "Kanto"})
CREATE (pokemon:Pokemon {name: "Pikachu", type: "Electric", level: 25})
CREATE (strategy:Strategy {name: "Type Advantage", success_rate: 0.85})
CREATE (goal:Goal {name: "Reach Pokemon Center", category: "navigation"})

// Strategic relationships
CREATE (strategy)-[:EFFECTIVE_AGAINST {confidence: 0.9}]->(pokemon)
CREATE (location)-[:CONNECTS_TO {route: "Route 1"}]->(location2:Location)
CREATE (goal)-[:ACHIEVED_BY {efficiency: 0.8}]->(strategy)
CREATE (pokemon)-[:FOUND_IN {probability: 0.3}]->(location)

// Experience relationships
CREATE (session:Session {id: "sess_123", success: true})
CREATE (session)-[:USED_STRATEGY]->(strategy)
CREATE (session)-[:ACHIEVED_GOAL]->(goal)
CREATE (session)-[:OCCURRED_IN]->(location)
```

**Strategic Memory Operations**:
```python
class StrategicMemory:
    def store_strategic_experience(self, strategy, outcome, context):
        """Store strategic experience for future reference"""
        with self.neo4j_driver.session() as session:
            session.run("""
                MATCH (s:Strategy {name: $strategy_name})
                CREATE (e:Experience {
                    timestamp: $timestamp,
                    success: $success,
                    efficiency: $efficiency,
                    context: $context
                })
                CREATE (s)-[:HAS_EXPERIENCE]->(e)
            """, strategy_name=strategy.name, timestamp=time.time(),
                success=outcome.success, efficiency=outcome.efficiency,
                context=context.to_dict())
    
    def retrieve_relevant_strategies(self, current_goal, current_context):
        """Retrieve strategies relevant to current situation"""
        with self.neo4j_driver.session() as session:
            result = session.run("""
                MATCH (g:Goal {name: $goal_name})-[:ACHIEVED_BY]->(s:Strategy)
                MATCH (s)-[:HAS_EXPERIENCE]->(e:Experience)
                WHERE e.success = true AND e.context.location = $location
                RETURN s, AVG(e.efficiency) as avg_efficiency
                ORDER BY avg_efficiency DESC
                LIMIT 5
            """, goal_name=current_goal, location=current_context.location)
            
            return [record for record in result]
```

        self.confidence_threshold = 0.7
        self.pattern_match_threshold = 0.8
        self.strategic_triggers = [
            'new_area_encountered',
            'unexpected_battle_outcome',
            'resource_depletion',
            'goal_progress_stalled'
        ]
    
    def should_trigger_strategic_planning(self, execution_state):
        # Check confidence levels
        if execution_state.action_confidence < self.confidence_threshold:
            return True, "low_confidence"
            
        # Check pattern matching success
        if execution_state.pattern_match_rate < self.pattern_match_threshold:
            return True, "novel_situation"
            
        # Check strategic triggers
        for trigger in self.strategic_triggers:
            if self.detect_trigger(execution_state, trigger):
                return True, trigger
                
        return False, None
```

**Pause-Based Coordination**:

        try:
            # Gather comprehensive game state
            full_state = self.gather_comprehensive_state()
            
            # Activate strategic reasoning
            strategic_plan = self.strategic_core.generate_plan(
                full_state, uncertainty_context
            )
            
            # Update real-time agent with new strategy
            self.real_time_agent.update_strategy(strategic_plan)
            
            # Cache strategic decisions for similar situations
            self.cache_strategic_decision(full_state, strategic_plan)
            
        finally:
            # Resume real-time execution
            self.skyemu_interface.resume_game()
```

        execution_state = StrategyExecutionState(plan)
        
        for step in plan.steps:
            # Execute step through real-time agent
            step_result = self.execute_strategy_step(step, real_time_agent)
            
            # Validate step completion
            validation_result = self.validate_step_completion(step, step_result)
            
            if validation_result.success:
                execution_state.mark_step_completed(step)
            else:
                # Handle step failure
                if validation_result.recoverable:
                    # Retry with adjustment
                    adjusted_step = self.adjust_step_for_retry(step, validation_result)
                    step_result = self.execute_strategy_step(adjusted_step, real_time_agent)
                else:
                    # Trigger strategic replanning
                    return self.trigger_strategic_replanning(execution_state)
            
            # Check for strategic drift
            if self.detect_strategic_drift(execution_state):
                return self.trigger_strategic_replanning(execution_state)
                
        return execution_state
```

**Progress Validation**:
```python
class ProgressValidator:
    def validate_strategic_progress(self, goal, current_state, time_elapsed):
        # Check objective progress
        objective_progress = self.measure_objective_progress(goal, current_state)
        
        # Check efficiency
        expected_progress = self.estimate_expected_progress(goal, time_elapsed)
        efficiency = objective_progress / expected_progress
        
        # Check for obstacles or complications
        obstacles = self.detect_obstacles(goal, current_state)
        
        return ProgressValidation(
            objective_progress=objective_progress,
            efficiency=efficiency,
