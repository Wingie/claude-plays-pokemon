# Eevee v2 Development Roadmap

## Vision Statement

Eevee v2 is a next-generation AI Pokemon gaming system that achieves real-time 60 FPS gameplay through **constraint-driven architecture** rather than optimization. The system maintains strategic coherence across unlimited gameplay duration while operating within hard real-time constraints.

## Core Architectural Principles

### 1. Constraint-Driven Design
- **Primary Constraint**: 60 FPS = 16.7ms total frame budget
- **AI Processing Budget**: ≤5ms per frame for execution layer
- **Fail-Fast Philosophy**: If resources unavailable, system fails immediately (no fallbacks)
- **Three-Layer Separation**: Execution (≤5ms) | Strategic (pause-based) | Memory (async)

### 2. Multi-Agent Architecture
```
Real-Time Agent (60 FPS)
├── Input: Screenshot + 4-frame history 
├── Input: Strategy object (JSON)
├── Output: Decision phase
└── Constraint: ≤5ms total processing

Thinker Agent (Pause-based)
├── Trigger: Uncertainty threshold exceeded
├── Processing: Flash-Exp reasoning (unlimited time)
├── Tools: All except button pressing
└── Output: Strategic plan + reward function

Management Agent (Background)  
├── Schedule: Periodic activation
├── Tools: Database R/W, long-term planning
├── Function: Meta-coordination
└── Constraint: Non-blocking operations
```

### 3. Performance-First Processing Paths
```
Known Situation (80% of frames):
Screenshot → Pattern Match → Cached Action → Execute (≤2ms)

Novel Situation (15% of frames):
Screenshot → Vision Model → Action Prediction → Execute (≤5ms)

Uncertain Situation (5% of frames):
Pause Game → Thinker Agent → Strategic Plan → Resume → Execute
```
