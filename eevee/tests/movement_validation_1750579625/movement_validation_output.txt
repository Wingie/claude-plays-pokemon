============================================================

OVERLAY IMAGES: /Users/wingston/code/claude-plays-pokemon/eevee/tests/movement_validation_1750579625
------------------------------------------------------------

TEST: Coarse 4x4 Grid
GRID SIZE: 4x4
LOCATION CLASS: route
VALID MOVEMENTS: ['U', 'L', 'R']
OBJECTS DETECTED: 0
RECOMMENDED PROMPT: exploration_strategy
PROMPT REASON: Overworld route area - navigation and exploration needed
----------------------------------------

DETAILED MOVEMENT SEQUENCES:
1-MOVE (3):
  âœ“ U - Grassy area continues upward
  âœ“ L - Consistent terrain to the left
  âœ“ R - Matching grassy surface to the right

2-MOVE (2):
  âž¤ U_L - Two-step path on similar grassy terrain
  âž¤ U_R - Diagonal path through consistent grassy surface

--- RAW AI RESPONSE ---
```json
VISUAL_DESCRIPTION: "The image shows a grid with a central position marked at coordinates (2,2). The terrain appears to be a mix of different surfaces with some areas having a similar texture."
LOCATION_TYPE: "Grassy and rocky terrain with patches of different colors."

TERRAIN_ANALYSIS:
UP: "Grassy area with similar texture to the center" - WALKABLE
DOWN: "Rocky surface with different texture" - BLOCKED
LEFT: "Grassy area with similar texture to the center" - WALKABLE
RIGHT: "Grassy area with similar texture to the center" - WALKABLE

VALID_SEQUENCES:
1_MOVE:
- ("U", "Grassy area continues upward")
- ("L", "Consistent terrain to the left")
- ("R", "Matching grassy surface to the right")

2_MOVE:
- ("U_L", "Two-step path on similar grassy terrain")
- ("U_R", "Diagonal path through consistent grassy surface")

TEST: Fine 8x8 Grid
GRID SIZE: 8x8
LOCATION CLASS: town
VALID MOVEMENTS: ['U', 'D', 'L', 'R']
OBJECTS DETECTED: 0
RECOMMENDED PROMPT: ai_navigation_with_memory_control
PROMPT REASON: Urban town area - structured navigation needed
----------------------------------------

DETAILED MOVEMENT SEQUENCES:
1-MOVE (4):
  âœ“ U - Similar terrain continues upward
  âœ“ D - Same surface type extends downward
  âœ“ L - Consistent terrain to the left
  âœ“ R - Matching surface to the right

2-MOVE (8):
  âž¤ U_U - Two-step path upward on similar terrain
  âž¤ D_D - Two-step path downward on similar terrain
  âž¤ L_L - Two-step path to the left on similar terrain
  âž¤ R_R - Two-step path to the right on similar terrain
  âž¤ U_L - Diagonal path upward and left on consistent surface
  âž¤ U_R - Diagonal path upward and right on consistent surface
  âž¤ D_L - Diagonal path downward and left on consistent surface
  âž¤ D_R - Diagonal path downward and right on consistent surface

```json
VISUAL_DESCRIPTION: The image shows a grid with a central character surrounded by various terrain types. The terrain includes different colored blocks and patterns.
LOCATION_TYPE: The environment appears to be a mix of different surfaces, possibly representing different rooms or areas.

TERRAIN_ANALYSIS:
UP: Similar terrain with a consistent pattern - WALKABLE
DOWN: Similar terrain with a consistent pattern - WALKABLE
LEFT: Similar terrain with a consistent pattern - WALKABLE
RIGHT: Similar terrain with a consistent pattern - WALKABLE

VALID_SEQUENCES:
1_MOVE:
- ("U", "Similar terrain continues upward")
- ("D", "Same surface type extends downward")
- ("L", "Consistent terrain to the left")
- ("R", "Matching surface to the right")

2_MOVE:
- ("U_U", "Two-step path upward on similar terrain")
- ("D_D", "Two-step path downward on similar terrain")
- ("L_L", "Two-step path to the left on similar terrain")
- ("R_R", "Two-step path to the right on similar terrain")
- ("U_L", "Diagonal path upward and left on consistent surface")
- ("U_R", "Diagonal path upward and right on consistent surface")
- ("D_L", "Diagonal path downward and left on consistent surface")
- ("D_R", "Diagonal path downward and right on consistent surface")

OBJECTS_VISIBLE:
Characters: [Multiple characters visible at various coordinates]
Structures: [No clear building or structure shapes visible]
Signs: [No clear sign or post shapes visible]
Items: [No clear item or object shapes visible]
