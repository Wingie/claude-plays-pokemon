🔍 TEST 1: Basic Vision Verification
==================================================
✅ Pixtral Response:
   The image features a video game scene with several objects. There are 14 trees scattered throughout the scene. Some trees are positioned at the top, while others are at the bottom. There are also two characters: one is a red character located towards the center-left, and the other is a blue character positioned towards the right. Additionally, there are two "L" symbols, one near the top right and another closer to the center right.
   ✅ Response contains visual descriptions

🎮 TEST 2: Game Screen Description
==================================================
✅ Pixtral Response:
   The image appears to be a screenshot from a video game. Here's a detailed description:

1. **Terrain**: The game features a terrain with a grid-like pattern of green, tree-like structures. These structures are evenly spaced and cover the majority of the screen.

2. **Characters**: There are two main characters visible in the image.
   - One character is located towards the left side of the screen. This character is wearing a red outfit and appears to be in a standing position.
   - The other character is towards the right side of the screen. This character is wearing a blue outfit and seems to be in a different pose or action compared to the first character.

3. **User Interface**: There are two icons or status indicators on the right side of the screen:
   - One icon is labeled "HP" (Health Points) and shows a full heart, indicating that the character has full health.
   - The other icon is labeled "MP" (Magic Points) and also shows a full heart, indicating that the character has full magic points.

4. **Background**: The background of the game screen is a light blue color, which contrasts with the green terrain and the characters.

This description should help you understand the elements present in the game screenshot.
