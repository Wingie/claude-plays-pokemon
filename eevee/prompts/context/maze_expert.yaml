    You are navigating a complex maze maze. These areas require systematic exploration 
    and memory-based pathfinding due to their intricate layouts.
    
    Current Task: {task}
    Recent Actions: {recent_actions}
    
    üß† MEMORY COMMANDS:
    Use these to leverage past  navigation experience:
    
    **Load maze Knowledge**:
    - `LOAD_MEMORIES: maze_[maze_name]` - Load specific maze solutions
    - `LOAD_MEMORIES: maze_patterns` - Load general maze navigation techniques
    - `LOAD_MEMORIES: viridian_maze` - Load Viridian maze specific knowledge
    - `LOAD_MEMORIES: tree_landmark_patterns` - Load visual landmark recognition
    
    **maze Prompt Control**:
    - `REQUEST_PROMPT: right_hand_rule` - Switch to systematic wall-following
    - `REQUEST_PROMPT: landmark_navigation` - Focus on visual landmark tracking
    - `REQUEST_PROMPT: maze_pathfinding` - Advanced maze-specific algorithms
    
    üó∫Ô∏è maze NAVIGATION STRATEGY:
    
    **Step 1 - maze Assessment**:
    - **Tree Density**: How thick is the maze cover?
    - **Path Visibility**: Are there clear dirt paths vs grass areas?
    - **Visual Landmarks**: Any distinctive tree formations or clearings?
    - **Known Location**: Have you been in this maze before?
    
    **Step 2 - Load Relevant Memories**:
    If this looks familiar: `LOAD_MEMORIES: maze_[name]`
    If first time: `LOAD_MEMORIES: maze_patterns`
    If completely lost: `REQUEST_PROMPT: maze_pathfinding`
    
    **Step 3 - Navigation Method Selection**:
    
    **For New mazes**:
    1. `REQUEST_PROMPT: right_hand_rule` - Keep right wall to your right
    2. Follow path systematically until you reach exit or dead end
    3. `SAVE_MEMORY: path_sequence_[directions] TAG: maze_[name]`
    
    **For Known mazes**:
    1. `LOAD_MEMORIES: maze_[name]_solution`
    2. Follow remembered successful path sequence
    3. If path blocked: `REQUEST_PROMPT: maze_adaptation`
    
    **For Partially Known**:
    1. `LOAD_MEMORIES: maze_patterns` 
    2. Look for familiar visual patterns
    3. Use landmark navigation: `REQUEST_PROMPT: landmark_navigation`
    
    üå≤ maze-SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES:
    
    **Right-Hand Wall Following**:
    - Keep your right hand on the "wall" (tree line)
    - Always turn right when possible
    - Go straight when right is blocked
    - Turn left only when straight and right are blocked
    - This guarantees you'll find exit eventually
    
    **Landmark Navigation**:
    - Distinctive tree formations
    - Clearings or open spaces  
    - Items on the ground (Pokeballs, etc.)
    - Different terrain textures
    - `SAVE_MEMORY: landmark_[description]_at_[location] TAG: maze_[name]`
    
    **Path Recognition**:
    - Dirt paths vs grass areas
    - Worn areas where NPCs walk
    - Subtle lighting differences
    - Breaks in tree patterns
    
    üíæ maze MEMORY SYSTEM:
    
    **Save Successful Routes**:
    - `SAVE_MEMORY: EXIT_FOUND: [full_path_sequence] TAG: maze_[name]_solution`
    - `SAVE_MEMORY: shortcut_[from]_to_[to] TAG: maze_[name]`
    - `SAVE_MEMORY: trainer_location_[description] TAG: maze_[name]_trainers`

    - `SAVE_MEMORY: DEAD_END: [path_to_dead_end] TAG: maze_[name]_avoid`
    - `SAVE_MEMORY: blocked_by_[obstacle] TAG: maze_[name]_avoid`
    
    üö® maze STUCK RECOVERY:
    
    **If Going in Circles**:
    1. `LOAD_MEMORIES: maze_[name]_avoid` - Check known dead ends
    2. `REQUEST_PROMPT: maze_unstuck_algorithm` - Get specialized help
    3. Try opposite direction of last 3 moves
    4. If still stuck: `REQUEST_PROMPT: landmark_navigation`
    
    **Emergency maze Navigation**:
    1. Stop and identify 3 visual landmarks around you
    2. Pick the most distinctive landmark as reference point
    3. Move systematically: up ‚Üí right ‚Üí down ‚Üí left from landmark
    4. `SAVE_MEMORY: emergency_reference_point_[description] TAG: maze_[name]`
    
    üéØ maze ACTION PROTOCOL:
    
    1. **Assess maze Type**: New vs known vs partially familiar
    2. **Load Appropriate Memories**: Previous solutions or general patterns
    3. **Select Navigation Method**: Wall-following vs landmark vs path-following
    4. **Execute 1-2 Movement Buttons**: Choose next direction based on method
    5. **Save Progress**: Record successful moves and discovered patterns
    
    maze-SPECIFIC RULES:
    - Never move more than 2 buttons per turn in maze
    - Always save successful path sequences for future use
    - Use landmarks for orientation when lost
    - Prefer systematic approaches over random movement
    - maze exits are usually at edges, not in center
    
    Use pokemon_controller with maze-appropriate directional movement.

    CAVE-SPECIFIC RULES:
    - Always test rock formations that look different
    - Save level transition points immediately when found
    - Use stairs/ladders as reference landmarks
    - Don't assume paths that look blocked actually are
    - Multi-level caves often require visiting levels multiple times
    - Cave exits are usually obvious (bright areas or entrance-like structures)
    
    Use pokemon_controller with cave-appropriate movement and interaction.
