    💡 INTELLIGENT MOVE SELECTION:
    
    **Step 1 - Load Type Knowledge**:
    `LOAD_MEMORIES: type_effectiveness` - Get type advantage data
    
    **Step 2 - Identify Pokemon Types**:
    - **Your Pokemon**: Check what type(s) your active Pokemon is
    - **Opponent Pokemon**: Observe opponent Pokemon name/appearance
    - **Move Types**: Identify what type each of your moves is
    
    **Step 3 - Calculate Effectiveness**:
    Super Effective (2x damage) moves > Neutral moves > Not Very Effective (0.5x) moves
    
    **Step 4 - Make Selection**:
    1. If super effective move available: Use it
    2. If no type advantage: Use strongest damage move
    3. If all moves not very effective: Use least bad option
    4. Avoid status moves unless strategic benefit
    
    **Common Move Types**:
    - Thundershock/Thunder = Electric
    - Bubble/Water Gun = Water
    - Ember/Flamethrower = Fire  
    - Vine Whip/Razor Leaf = Grass
    - Tackle/Scratch/Quick Attack = Normal
    - Growl/Tail Whip/Leer = Status (no damage)
    
    🎯 BATTLE DECISION TREE:
    
    **Priority 1 - Type Advantage**:
    - `LOAD_MEMORIES: type_effectiveness`
    - Check if any move is super effective against opponent
    - If yes: Select that move immediately
    
    **Priority 2 - Damage Output**:
    - If no type advantage: Choose highest damage move
    - Prefer damaging moves over status moves
    - Check move power if visible
    
    **Priority 3 - Pokemon Health**:
    - If your Pokemon HP critical: `REQUEST_PROMPT: battle_emergency`
    - Consider switching Pokemon or using healing items
    - If opponent Pokemon HP low: Use any damaging move to finish
    
    **Priority 4 - Strategic Considerations**:
    - `LOAD_MEMORIES: trainer_[trainer_name]` - Trainer-specific strategies
    - `LOAD_MEMORIES: pokemon_[pokemon_name]_counters` - Pokemon-specific tactics

    ```
    
    🔬 TYPE CALCULATION ALGORITHM:
    
    **Step 1 - Identify All Types**:
    1. `LOAD_MEMORIES: pokemon_types_database` - Get Pokemon type data
    2. Your Pokemon type(s): [Identify from name/appearance]
    3. Opponent Pokemon type(s): [Identify from name/appearance]
    4. `LOAD_MEMORIES: move_types_database` - Get move type data
    5. Available move types: [Map each move name to type]
    
    **Step 2 - Calculate Effectiveness for Each Move**:
    For each available move:
    1. Identify move type
    2. Check effectiveness against opponent type(s)
    3. If opponent has dual types: Use effectiveness against both types
    4. Calculate final multiplier: (Type1 effectiveness) × (Type2 effectiveness)
    
    **Step 3 - Rank Moves by Effectiveness**:
    1. **4x Super Effective**: Move super effective against both opponent types
    2. **2x Super Effective**: Move super effective against one opponent type
    3. **1x Neutral**: Normal effectiveness
    4. **0.5x Not Very Effective**: Resisted by one opponent type
    5. **0.25x Doubly Resisted**: Resisted by both opponent types
    6. **0x No Effect**: Immunity
    
    **Step 4 - Make Recommendation**:
    1. Choose highest effectiveness multiplier
    2. If tie: Choose move with higher base power
    3. If still tie: Choose move with better accuracy
    4. Factor in PP (Power Points) remaining
    
    🎮 MOVE SELECTION PROCESS:
    
    **Analysis Protocol**:
    1. **Opponent Analysis**: 
       - `LOAD_MEMORIES: pokemon_[opponent_name]_types`
       - Identify opponent type(s) from visual cues or name
    
    2. **Move Analysis**:
       - `LOAD_MEMORIES: move_types_database`
       - Map each available move to its type
    
    3. **Effectiveness Calculation**:
       - Calculate type effectiveness for each move
       - Account for dual-type interactions
    
    4. **Strategic Selection**:
       - Prefer 2x+ effective moves
       - Avoid 0.5x or worse effectiveness unless no choice
       - Consider move power and accuracy
    
    **Decision Matrix**:
    ```
    Priority 1: 4x Super Effective moves (if available)
    Priority 2: 2x Super Effective moves 
    Priority 3: High-power neutral moves
    Priority 4: Low-power neutral moves
    Priority 5: Not very effective moves (if forced)
    Priority 6: Status moves (only if no damage options)
    ```

    - `SAVE_MEMORY: [pokemon]_weak_to_[type]_type_moves TAG: pokemon_weaknesses`
    
    🎯 ADVANCED TYPE STRATEGIES:
    
    **Dual-Type Calculations**:
    - Flying/Normal: Electric hits 2x (Flying), Normal (Normal) = 2x total
    - Water/Ground: Grass hits 2x (Water), 2x (Ground) = 4x total
    - Fire/Flying: Electric hits 2x (Flying), Normal (Fire) = 2x total
    - Rock/Ground: Water hits 2x (Rock), 2x (Ground) = 4x total
    
    **Common Pokemon Type Combinations**:
    ```
    Pidgey/Spearow: Normal/Flying
    Zubat: Poison/Flying  
    Geodude/Onix: Rock/Ground
    Magnemite: Electric/Steel
    Psyduck: Water (pure)
    Machop: Fighting (pure)
    Gastly: Ghost/Poison
    ```
    
    **Type Strategy Recommendations**:
    - Against Flying types: Use Electric moves
    - Against Water types: Use Grass or Electric moves
    - Against Ground types: Use Water or Grass moves  
    - Against Rock types: Use Water, Grass, or Fighting moves
    - Against Normal types: Use Fighting moves
    
    TYPE CALCULATION PROTOCOL:
    1. **Load Type Databases**: Pokemon types and move types
    2. **Identify All Types**: Your Pokemon, opponent, and available moves
    3. **Calculate Effectiveness**: For each move against opponent type(s)
    4. **Rank Options**: From most to least effective
    5. **Make Recommendation**: Choose optimal move based on calculations
    6. **Save Results**: Record effective combinations for future reference
    
    CRITICAL TYPE RULES:
    - Always check for dual-type Pokemon (two types = complex calculations)
    - Super effective moves (2x+) almost always preferred
    - Status moves have no type effectiveness (always 1x for damage calculation)
    - Some Pokemon types resist many common moves (Steel, Fire)
    - Electric moves useless against Ground types (0x damage)
    
    Use pokemon_controller with move selection optimized for type effectiveness.
