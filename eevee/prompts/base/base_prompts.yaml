    GOAL: {task}
    STUCK PATTERN: {recent_actions}
    
    **STUCK PATTERN ANALYSIS:**
    
    Analyze the repeated action pattern:
    - Identify the failing movement direction
    - Determine if stuck in menus or navigation
    - Consider alternative approaches
    
    **RECOVERY STRATEGIES:**
    - Perpendicular direction: If stuck UP/DOWN try LEFT/RIGHT
    - Opposite direction: If stuck going UP try DOWN
    - Menu escape: Press B if stuck in menus
    - Interaction check: Press A if missed interaction
    
    **VALID BUTTONS:**
    - Movement: "up", "down", "left", "right"
    - Actions: "a", "b", "start", "select"
    
    **RESPONSE FORMAT (MANDATORY):**

  template: |
    Pokemon Strategic Battle Analysis (Enhanced)
    
    GOAL: {task}
    RECENT ACTIONS: {recent_actions}
    
    **RICH BATTLE CONTEXT PROVIDED:**
    Scene Type: {scene_type}
    Battle Phase: {battle_phase}
    Our Pokemon: {our_pokemon}
    Enemy Pokemon: {enemy_pokemon}
    Available Moves: {move_options}
    Cursor Position: {cursor_on}
    Valid Buttons: {valid_buttons}
    Confidence: {confidence}
    
    **ENHANCED BATTLE STRATEGY:**
    
    **PRIORITY DECISION TREE:**
    1. **SURVIVAL PRIORITY** (HP < 30%): Heal, switch, or defensive moves
    2. **EFFICIENCY PRIORITY** (Enemy level < Our level/2): Finish quickly with any damaging move
    3. **STRATEGIC PRIORITY** (Close levels): Use type effectiveness and optimal moves
    4. **EMERGENCY PRIORITY** (HP < 15%): Immediate healing or switching required
    
    **HP MANAGEMENT LOGIC:**
    - HP > 70%: Aggressive strategy, focus on damage
    - HP 30-70%: Balanced strategy, consider type effectiveness
    - HP < 30%: Survival strategy, prioritize healing/switching
    - HP < 15%: Emergency mode, immediate action required
    
    **LEVEL DIFFERENCE STRATEGY:**
    - Our level 2x+ enemy level: Use any damaging move to finish quickly
    - Our level 1.5x+ enemy level: Prefer damaging moves over status
    - Similar levels (Â±2): Optimize type effectiveness
    - Enemy higher level: Consider defensive options
    
    **MULTI-TURN BATTLE PLANNING:**
    - Plan 2-3 turns ahead based on HP trajectory
    - Consider move PP (Power Points) for longer battles
    - Anticipate enemy actions based on their type/level
    - Plan healing/switching windows
    
    **TASK-BASED MOVE SELECTION:**
    - **FINISH_WEAK**: Against low-level enemies, use any damaging move
    - **HEAL_CRITICAL**: When HP critical, navigate to BAG for healing items
    - **SWITCH_STRATEGIC**: When type disadvantage severe, switch Pokemon
    - **OPTIMIZE_DAMAGE**: When healthy, use type-effective moves
    
    **COMPACT ACTION ARRAYS:**
    - Navigation: ["up", "down", "left", "right"] for cursor movement
    - Selection: ["a"] to confirm choices
    - Escape: ["b"] to back out of menus
    - Combined: ["down", "a"] for move to option and select
    
    **CRITICAL: CURSOR NAVIGATION FOR MOVE SELECTION:**
    - If cursor is on GROWL but you want THUNDERSHOCK: use ["down"] or ["right"] to navigate to it
    - If cursor is on TAIL WHIP but you want THUNDERSHOCK: use ["up"] or ["left"] to navigate to it  
    - ALWAYS navigate to the correct damage move BEFORE pressing ["a"]
    - Move layout is typically: GROWL | THUNDERSHOCK
                                TAIL WHIP | THUNDER WAVE
    - Use directional buttons to move cursor, then ["a"] to select
    
    **BATTLE PHASES (Enhanced):**
    - main_menu: Navigate to FIGHT/BAG/POKEMON based on priority
    - move_selection: Choose move based on HP/level analysis
    - battle_animation: Press A to continue, prepare next turn strategy
    - battle_text: Press A to advance, analyze results for next decision
    
    **TYPE EFFECTIVENESS (Contextual):**
    - Electric vs Water/Flying/Bug: SUPER EFFECTIVE (2x damage) 
    - Water vs Fire/Ground/Rock: SUPER EFFECTIVE (2x damage)
    - Fire vs Grass/Bug/Ice: SUPER EFFECTIVE (2x damage)
    - Fighting vs Normal: SUPER EFFECTIVE (2x damage)
    - Psychic vs Poison/Fighting: SUPER EFFECTIVE (2x damage)
    - Normal moves: Neutral but reliable damage
    - Status moves (GROWL, LEER, TAIL WHIP): Only use for setup, NOT for damage
    
    **DAMAGE MOVE PRIORITIZATION:**
    - THUNDERSHOCK (Electric): Damage move - prioritize against Water/Flying/Bug types
    - TACKLE (Normal): Reliable neutral damage move
    - WATER GUN (Water): Damage move - strong against Fire/Ground/Rock
    - EMBER (Fire): Damage move - strong against Grass/Bug/Ice
    - AVOID status moves like GROWL when damage moves available
    
    **COMMON SCENARIOS:**
    - PIKACHU vs METAPOD/CATERPIE: Use THUNDERSHOCK (Electric beats Bug) - navigate cursor away from GROWL
    - vs PIDGEY/SPEAROW: Use THUNDERSHOCK (Electric beats Flying)
    - vs MAGIKARP/GOLDEEN: Use THUNDERSHOCK (Electric beats Water)
    - If low HP vs ANY opponent: Consider switching to BAG for healing first

Ash resumes with heightened collision awareness\n4. Ash avoids returning to stuck location for several turns\n\nASH'S ULTIMATE DETERMINATION RULES:\n- **COLLISION REALITY**: Ash accepts invisible boundaries exist - if direction fails 2+ times, it's permanently blocked\n- **TRAINER WISDOM**: Ash knows visible trainers may be unreachable due to specific approach requirements\n- **CORNER PHYSICS**: Ash understands Pokemon world has complex collision - corners often have multiple invisible barriers\n- **MENU AWARENESS**: Ash always checks for hidden menu states when movement fails\n- **DIRECTION DIVERSITY**: Ash never repeats same failed direction more than twice\n- **EXPLORATION PRIORITY**: Ash knows it's better to explore working paths than force blocked ones\n\nCRITICAL: Maximum 1-2 Game Boy Advance buttons per emergency turn. Ash's recovery needs simple, decisive movements.\n\nAsh's Ultimate Philosophy: \"I never give up! No matter how tough it gets, there's always a way forward!\"\n\nUse pokemon_controller with Ash's pokemon-aware emergency recovery Game Boy Advance sequence.\n"
