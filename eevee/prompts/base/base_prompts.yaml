    Goal Status: {current_goal_status}
    Progress: {goal_progress}%
    Recommended Actions: {recommended_goal_actions}
    
    **PRIORITY DECISION FRAMEWORK:**
    1. **FIRST: Check if Pokemon actually need healing:**
       - If all Pokemon have full/green HP: Exit menu (press "b") - no healing needed
       - Only consider healing if Pokemon have damaged HP (yellow/red bars)
    
    2. **IF healing IS needed and goal recommends "visit_pokemon_center":**
       - Press "b" to exit Pokemon menu immediately
       - Return to overworld to navigate to Pokemon Center
    
    3. **IF healing IS needed and goal recommends "use_potion":**
       - Only proceed if you have healing items available
       - Otherwise exit menu and find Pokemon Center
    
    4. **IF no healing needed or no specific goal recommendations:**
       - Analyze Pokemon status as normal
       - Exit with "b" when analysis complete
    
    **MENU NAVIGATION RULES:**
    - To exit any Pokemon menu: Press "b" 
    - To select Pokemon: Press "a"
    - To navigate between Pokemon: Use "up"/"down"

    Pokemon Navigation Analysis
    
    GOAL: {task}
    RECENT ACTIONS: {recent_actions}
    
    **VISUAL ANALYSIS DATA:**
    {visual_analysis_json}
    
    **COORDINATE_TAGS FROM VISUAL ANALYSIS:**
    The visual analysis above contains coordinate_tags with exact locations of objects.
    Check for dialogue, obstacles, Pokemon Centers, trainers, and coordinate overlays.
    
    **NAVIGATION ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:**
    
    **STEP 1 - CHECK FOR DIALOGUE FIRST:**
    If dialogue is visible in the visual analysis, press A to engage/continue dialogue immediately.
    
    **STEP 2 - COORDINATE-BASED PATHFINDING (PRIORITY #1):**
    **MANDATORY**: Check coordinate_tags in the VISUAL ANALYSIS DATA section above FIRST
    - Look in the JSON above for "coordinate_tags" array with object locations
    - Find interesting targets: trainers, pokemon_centers, route_exits, buildings
    - Your current position ({current_x},{current_y}) from RAM data
    - Extract target x,y coordinates from coordinate_tags for navigation
    - Use pathfinding_action with target_x, target_y when targets found
    
    **STEP 3 - MANUAL NAVIGATION (only if pathfinding unavailable):**
    If coordinates are not visible or pathfinding fails:
    - Use visual analysis data for movement planning
    - Check valid movements from visual analysis
    - Analyze visual description for obstacles and opportunities
    - One button press per decision for careful movement
    
    **PATHFINDING-FIRST STRATEGY:**
    - ALWAYS attempt coordinate-based navigation before manual movement
    - Extract target coordinates from coordinate_tags in visual analysis
    - Priority targets: trainer > pokemon_center > route_exit > building
    - Justify why manual movement is chosen over pathfinding
    
    **GOAL-BASED NAVIGATION:**
    Current Task: {task}
    - IF task involves healing: Look for red-roofed Pokemon Centers
    - IF task involves exploration: Systematically explore unexplored areas  
    - IF task involves specific locations: Use coordinates to navigate efficiently
    - Always prioritize coordinate-based pathfinding over manual movement
    
    **POKEMON CENTER PATHFINDING:**
    Only if GOAL contains "heal" AND Pokemon actually need healing (damaged HP):
    - CHECK coordinate_tags for "pokemon_center" or "nurse_joy" objects
    - EXTRACT coordinates from matching coordinate_tags entry
    - USE pathfinding_action to navigate directly to Pokemon Center coordinates
    - EXAMPLE: coordinate_tags shows pokemon_center at 15,10 → use pathfinding_action
    - FALLBACK: Manual navigation only if center coordinates not visible
    - If Pokemon are already fully healed, ignore healing goals and focus on other objectives
    
    **PATHFINDING SYSTEM (PRIMARY NAVIGATION METHOD):**
    Current Coordinates: Map {current_map_id} at ({current_x},{current_y})
    
    **COORDINATE_TAGS ANALYSIS (MANDATORY FIRST STEP):**
    - CRITICAL: Check coordinate_tags in the VISUAL ANALYSIS DATA section above
    - You MUST check coordinate_tags array for navigation targets before any action
    - Your current position ({current_x},{current_y}) from RAM data
    - ALWAYS scan coordinate_tags for interesting destinations (trainers, buildings, exits)
    - coordinate_tags format: {{"x": 31, "y": 17, "object": "trainer", "description": "..."}}
    
    **PATHFINDING INTEGRATION (ALWAYS USE WHEN POSSIBLE):**
    - STEP 1: Check coordinate_tags for navigation targets (trainer, pokemon_center, etc.)
    - STEP 2: Extract x,y coordinates from matching coordinate_tags entry
    - STEP 3: Use pathfinding_action with target_x, target_y from coordinate_tags
    - Example: coordinate_tags shows trainer at 31,17 → use pathfinding_action with target_x: 31, target_y: 17
    - **EFFICIENCY**: Pathfinding replaces 5-10 manual button presses with 1 action
    - **ACCURACY**: Eliminates getting stuck or lost during navigation
    
    **COORDINATE VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:**
    - MUST check coordinate_tags array for available navigation targets
    - MUST extract target coordinates from coordinate_tags before movement decisions  
    - MUST explain why pathfinding cannot be used if choosing manual movement
    
    **EXAMPLE COORDINATE_TAGS USAGE:**
    If VISUAL ANALYSIS DATA shows: "coordinate_tags": [{{"x": 15, "y": 10, "object": "pokemon_center"}}]
    Then use: {{"pathfinding_action": "move_to_coordinate", "target_x": 15, "target_y": 10}}
    
    **COORDINATE EXTRACTION STEPS:**
    Step 1: Look for "coordinate_tags" array in VISUAL ANALYSIS DATA section above
    Step 2: Find objects matching your goal (pokemon_center for healing, trainer for battles)
    Step 3: Extract exact "x" and "y" values from that object  
    Step 4: Use those EXACT numbers as target_x and target_y
    
    **EXAMPLE EXTRACTION:**
    VISUAL ANALYSIS DATA shows: "coordinate_tags": [{{"x": 13, "y": 23, "object": "pokemon_center"}}]
    → Extract: target_x = 13, target_y = 23 (use exact numbers from JSON)
    
    **VALID BUTTONS:**
    - Movement: "up", "down", "left", "right"
    - Actions: "a", "b", "start", "select"
    
    **RESPONSE FORMAT (MANDATORY):**
    Return ONLY a JSON object with no additional text.
    
    **YOU MUST CHOOSE EXACTLY ONE OF THESE TWO RESPONSE FORMATS:**
    
    **DECISION FLOWCHART:**
    1. Do coordinate_tags contain any objects (pokemon_center, trainer, etc.)? 
       → YES: Use FORMAT A (pathfinding_action ONLY)
       → NO: Use FORMAT B (button_presses ONLY)
    
    **FORMAT A: Pathfinding Response (when coordinate_tags available)**
    - ONLY include: pathfinding_action, target_x, target_y, reasoning, coordinate_source, confidence
    - NEVER include: button_presses, context_detected, observations
    
    ```json
    {{
      "pathfinding_action": "move_to_coordinate",
      "target_x": 13,
      "target_y": 23,
      "reasoning": "pathfinding_to_pokemon_center_at_x13_y23",
      "coordinate_source": "coordinate_tags",
      "confidence": "high"
    }}
    ```
    
    **FORMAT B: Manual Movement Response (when no targets available)**  
    - ONLY include: button_presses, reasoning, observations, context_detected, confidence
    - NEVER include: pathfinding_action, target_x, target_y, coordinate_source

      "observations": "No interesting targets found in coordinate_tags",
      "context_detected": "navigation",
      "confidence": "medium"
    }}
    ```
    
    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    - DO NOT include both pathfinding_action AND button_presses
    - DO NOT make up coordinates - use exact values from coordinate_tags
    - DO NOT use manual movement if coordinate_tags contain targets
    
    Do not include any text before or after the JSON. No markdown, no code blocks, no explanations.

    - **stuck_recovery**: If same scene repeating or movement failing
    - **inventory_analysis**: Bag screen, item lists, "ITEMS/KEY ITEMS/POKEBALLS"
    - **pokemon_party_analysis**: Pokemon summary, party status, level up screens

    **COORDINATE ANALYSIS (New Enhancement):**
    🗺️ The screenshot contains a coordinate grid overlay with X,Y numbers on each tile.
    Look for interesting objects/locations and note their coordinates:
    
    **Objects to identify with coordinates:**
    - Pokemon Centers (buildings with red roofs)
    - NPCs/Trainers (human characters)
    - Items on ground (pokeballs, objects)
    - Route exits/cave entrances
    - Tall grass areas
    - Water/surf areas
    - Buildings/shops/gyms
    
    Include coordinate_tags array in your response with format:
    "coordinate_tags": [
      {{"x": 15, "y": 8, "object": "pokemon_center", "description": "Pokemon Center with red roof", "map_id": "current_map"}},

    GOAL: {task}
    BUILDING: Pokemon Center
    LOCATION: Pokemon Center (coordinates from RAM data)
    
    **MANDATORY RAM DATA CHECK (Execute First):**
    RAM Available: {ram_available}
    Party Health Status: {party_health_status}
    Healthy Pokemon: {party_healthy_pokemon}/{party_total_pokemon}
    Fainted Pokemon: {party_fainted_pokemon}
    Critical HP Pokemon: {party_critical_pokemon}
    Needs Healing: {needs_healing}
    At Pokemon Center: {at_pokemon_center}
    
    **MANDATORY DECISION LOGIC (NO EXCEPTIONS):**
    - IF needs_healing = true → YOU MUST HEAL (no choice, approach Nurse Joy immediately)
    - IF needs_healing = false → YOU MUST EXIT (no choice, leave Pokemon Center immediately)
    - NO THINKING, NO CONSIDERATION - FOLLOW RAM DATA EXACTLY
    - NEVER override the needs_healing flag with your own judgment
    
    **CURRENT POKEMON PARTY STATUS:**
    Total Pokemon: {party_total_pokemon}
    Healthy: {party_healthy_pokemon}
    Fainted: {party_fainted_pokemon} 
    Critical HP: {party_critical_pokemon}
    Overall Status: {party_health_status}
    
    **COMPLETE HEALING SEQUENCE (needs_healing = true):**
    Phase 1: Approach Nurse Joy (press ↑)
    Phase 2: Interact with Nurse Joy (press A)
    Phase 3: Confirm healing "Yes" (press A)
    Phase 4: Wait through healing animation (press A to advance dialogue)
    Phase 5: Acknowledge completion (press A)
    Phase 6: Exit Pokemon Center (press ↓ repeatedly)
    
    **HEALING DETECTION LOGIC:**
    - If you see dialogue text → press A to advance
    - If you see "Yes/No" option → press A to select Yes
    - If you see Nurse Joy idle → press A to interact
    - If healing complete → press ↓ to exit
    
    **EXIT SEQUENCE (needs_healing = false):**
    - Press ↓ repeatedly until outside Pokemon Center
    
    **PATHFINDING ASSISTANCE:**
    Current Coordinates: Map {current_map_id} at ({current_x},{current_y})
    
    **COORDINATE OVERLAY READING (VISUAL ONLY):**
    - CRITICAL: Read coordinates ONLY from the visual grid overlay on the screenshot
    - Every tile displays its X,Y coordinates - look for these numbers on screen
    - Your position ({current_x},{current_y}) is at the center where the player sprite is
    - To find the exit: Look for the door tile and read its displayed coordinates
    - Use pathfinding_action with the exact coordinates you SEE on the screen overlay
    
    **HEALING LOCATION BOOKMARKING:**
    - Successful healing will automatically bookmark this Pokemon Center
    - Future visits can use coordinate-based pathfinding to return here efficiently
    - Location will be saved at ({current_x},{current_y}) for reference
    
    **AUTOMATIC RESPONSE BASED ON SITUATION:**
    
    {{% if needs_healing %}}
    
    **HEALING SEQUENCE - Choose appropriate response:**
    
    If Nurse Joy is idle or you need to approach:
