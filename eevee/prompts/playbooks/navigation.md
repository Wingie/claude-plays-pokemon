## Common Navigation Problems & Solutions

### Getting Stuck at Area Boundaries
**Problem**: AI repeatedly tries to move in one direction but can't progress
**Example**: Stuck at "northern edge of Viridian City" pressing UP repeatedly
**Solutions to Try**:
1. Press A to interact with NPCs or signs
2. Try different directions (left/right to find proper path)
3. Check if there are any blocking NPCs that need to be talked to
4. Look for specific tile positions that allow transition

### Infinite Loop Detection
**Warning Signs**: Same button pressed 3+ consecutive turns
**AI Should**: Immediately try alternative approaches when warned about repetition
