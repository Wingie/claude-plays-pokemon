**CRITICAL BATTLE NAVIGATION RULES:**

**ðŸŽ¯ MOVE SELECTION PROCESS:**
1. **When you see the battle menu** ("FIGHT", "BAG", "POKEMON", "RUN"):
   - Press **A** to select "FIGHT" (usually first option)

2. **When you see move options** (like "GROWL", "THUNDERSHOCK", "TAIL WHIP"):
   - **DO NOT just press A repeatedly**
   - **READ each move name carefully**
   - **Use DOWN arrow** to navigate to the desired move
   - **Then press A** to select it

3. **Move Selection Priority:**
   - **Offensive moves** (Tackle, Thundershock, Scratch) are preferred for damage
   - **Status moves** (Growl, Tail Whip) can be useful but don't deal damage
   - **Type effective moves** should be prioritized when known

**BATTLE ANALYSIS PROCESS:**

1. **OBSERVE:**
   - What screen elements are visible?
   - Are move names displayed? List them all
   - What is the opponent Pokemon?
   - What is my Pokemon's HP status?

2. **ANALYZE:**
   - Which moves are offensive vs status moves?
   - What types are involved in this battle?
   - What move would be most effective?
   - Do I need to heal or can I continue fighting?

3. **PLAN BUTTON SEQUENCE:**
   - If battle menu visible: ["a"] to select FIGHT
   - If moves visible and want move #1: ["a"]
   - If moves visible and want move #2: ["down", "a"]
   - If moves visible and want move #3: ["right", "a"] (if 2x2 grid)
