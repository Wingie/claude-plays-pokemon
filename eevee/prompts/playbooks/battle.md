## 🎮 **CRITICAL: HOW BATTLES START**

### **🚨 BATTLES ARE AUTOMATIC - YOU DON'T INITIATE THEM! 🚨**
- **Trainer battles start AUTOMATICALLY** when you walk into their line of sight
- **Wild Pokemon battles start AUTOMATICALLY** when walking in tall grass  
- **You do NOT press any buttons to start battles**
- **Your job**: Walk around exploring - battles happen to you automatically
- **Battle initiation**: The screen will change to battle mode without your input

## **⚔️ BATTLE NAVIGATION RULES**

### **🎯 MOVE SELECTION PROCESS:**
1. **When you see the battle menu** ("FIGHT", "BAG", "POKEMON", "RUN"):
   - Press **A** to select "FIGHT" (usually first option)

2. **When you see move options** (like "GROWL", "THUNDERSHOCK", "TAIL WHIP"):
   - **DO NOT just press A repeatedly**
   - **READ each move name carefully**
   - **Use DOWN arrow** to navigate to the desired move
   - **Then press A** to select it

3. **Move Selection Priority:**
   - **Offensive moves** (Tackle, Thundershock, Scratch) are preferred for damage
   - **Status moves** (Growl, Tail Whip) can be useful but don't deal damage
   - **Type effective moves** should be prioritized when known

**BATTLE ANALYSIS PROCESS:**

1. **OBSERVE:**
   - What screen elements are visible?
   - Are move names displayed? List them all
   - What is the opponent Pokemon?
   - What is my Pokemon's HP status?

2. **ANALYZE:**
   - Which moves are offensive vs status moves?
   - What types are involved in this battle?
   - What move would be most effective?
   - Do I need to heal or can I continue fighting?

3. **PLAN BUTTON SEQUENCE:**
   - If battle menu visible: ["a"] to select FIGHT
   - If moves visible and want move #1: ["a"]
   - If moves visible and want move #2: ["down", "a"]
   - If moves visible and want move #3: ["right", "a"] (if 2x2 grid)
   - If moves visible and want move #4: ["down", "right", "a"] (if 2x2 grid)

**SMART MOVE SELECTION ALGORITHM:**

1. **Identify Move Types**: 
   - Thundershock = Electric
   - Bubble/Water Gun = Water  
   - Ember/Flamethrower = Fire
   - Vine Whip/Razor Leaf = Grass
   - Tackle/Scratch/Quick Attack = Normal
   - Growl/Tail Whip/Leer = Status (no damage)

2. **Opponent Type Recognition**:
   - Pidgey/Spearow = Normal/Flying
   - Rattata/Raticate = Normal
   - Caterpie/Weedle = Bug
   - Geodude/Onix = Rock/Ground
   - Zubat = Poison/Flying
   - Magikarp = Water
   - Psyduck = Water
   - Machop = Fighting

3. **Priority System**:
   - **First Priority**: Super effective moves (2x damage)
   - **Second Priority**: Neutral offensive moves  
   - **Third Priority**: Not very effective moves (still damage)
   - **Last Resort**: Status moves (no damage)

**BATTLE DECISION TREE:**
1. Can I use a super effective move? → Use it
2. Do I have a strong neutral move? → Use it
3. Is my Pokemon low HP? → Consider switching/healing
4. All moves not very effective? → Use strongest available
5. Only status moves? → Use one that helps (like reducing opponent's attack)

**CRITICAL REMINDERS:**
- **Never just spam A button** in move selection
- **Always read move names** before selecting
- **Use direction buttons** to navigate to desired moves
- **Calculate type effectiveness** before choosing moves
- **Prioritize DAMAGE over status effects** in most battles
