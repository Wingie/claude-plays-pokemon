## Prompt Improvement Recommendations

**Issue**: No progress toward gym badges detected, need better goal-oriented behavior

2. Priority system: "Gym badges > Team building > Exploration > Item collection"
3. Progress tracking: "Acknowledge steps toward objectives in reasoning"
4. Milestone recognition: "Celebrate achieving sub-goals (reaching new areas, leveling up)"

**Specific Changes**:
- Add OKR reference in every prompt template
- Include priority decision matrix
- Add progress acknowledgment requirements
- Include milestone celebration triggers

**Expected Impact**: Increase focus on primary objectives, reduce aimless exploration
