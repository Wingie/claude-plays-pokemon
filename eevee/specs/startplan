  🚀 Tomorrow's Session Plan - Battle System Refinement

  Priority 1: Battle Detection Reliability

  Issue: AI sometimes uses exploration_strategy even when saying "wild Pokemon battle"
  Tasks:
  - Debug why battle context isn't always passed to detection function
  - Add more specific battle UI indicators
  - Test battle detection with actual game screenshots
  - Implement battle memory (remember we're in battle between turns)

  Priority 2: Move Selection Intelligence

  Issue: AI knows Thundershock > Caterpie but struggles with menu navigation
  Tasks:
  - Map common moves to their typical grid positions
  - Add type effectiveness database to battle template
  - Implement "scan moves first, then select best" strategy
  - Test with actual Pokemon battle scenarios

  Priority 3: Battle State Management

  Issue: AI doesn't track battle progression or health changes
  Tasks:
  - Add battle turn counting and progression tracking
  - Implement health-based decision making (heal, switch, attack)
  - Recognize battle end conditions (victory, defeat, capture)
  - Proper transition back to exploration mode

  Priority 4: API Response Reliability

  Issue: Still getting empty responses (0 length, no reasoning)
  Tasks:
  - Investigate Gemini API timeout/rate limiting issues
  - Test prompt length limits and optimization
  - Add fallback prompts for API failures
  - Debug screenshot + prompt size combinations

  Priority 5: Documentation & Testing

  Tasks:
  - Update CLAUDE.md with new battle system architecture
  - Create comprehensive battle scenario tests
  - Document known issues and workarounds
  - Add battle system troubleshooting guide

🎮 TURN 8: Pressed ['a']
💭 FULL AI REASONING:
   Observation: I am in a battle against a Caterpie. My Pokemon, Pikachu, is at 22/24 HP and paralyzed. The available moves are Growl, Thundershock, Tail Whip, and Thunder Wave.  The text shows "Pika's STATIC paralyzed Wild".  Caterpie is paralyzed.

Analysis: Pikachu is paralyzed, reducing the chance of a successful attack.  Tail Whip lowers the opponent's defense, making Thundershock more effective next turn.  Since Caterpie is already paralyzed, Thunder Wave is redundant. Growl lowers the opponent's attack, but Tail Whip is more beneficial for maximizing the effectiveness of Thundershock.  I will select "Thundershock" to defeat Caterpie quickly, despite the paralysis.

Action: I will select "Thundershock". The button sequence is ['a'].

🎮 TURN 9: Pressed ['down']
💭 FULL AI REASONING:
   Observation: The battle against Caterpie is over.  Pikachu used Growl.  The next action is to continue exploring.


Analysis: The battle is won.  Since the game automatically advances after a battle, no specific button press is needed to proceed with exploration.  The next step is to choose a direction to move.  Let's assume the previous direction was successful; therefore, we can continue in that direction.  If no direction is known, we will arbitrarily choose 'down'.

Action: I will press 'down' to continue exploring.

Analysis:  Since the previous move was down, and we're instructed to try horizontal movement, we should try moving right.

Analysis: The previous two moves were 'down' and 'right'.  Since we are instructed to try vertical movement, and 'down' has already been tried, we should try 'up'.

Analysis:  Pikachu is an Electric type. Caterpie is a Bug type. Electric is super effective against Bug, so I should use a Electric move if available.  I will select "FIGHT" and then attack with my strongest move.

Analysis: I'm stuck in the Bag menu. The instruction was to interact with the environment, but that didn't resolve the situation. I need to exit the Bag menu to resume exploration.  The 'CLOSE BAG' button suggests the way out.

Analysis: The user instructed to interact with the environment using the 'A' button.  Given the proximity to the trainer, pressing 'A' might initiate a battle. However, based on the game rules, battles start automatically when approaching a trainer.  Therefore, moving towards the trainer (left) is a more strategic action than pressing 'A'.

   Observation: I am currently in a battle with a wild Weedle.

Analysis:  The prompt mentions that I'm stuck, and to try horizontal movement instead of the up/down movements that led to the current battle. Since I'm in a battle, any movement command will be ignored until the battle is over.  My immediate priority is to win the battle, then I can continue exploring. No action is needed from the `pokemon_controller` at this time.

Action:  No action needed using `pokemon_controller` yet. The battle must be resolved first.  I'll wait for the battle to conclude, then I will resume exploring using a horizontal movement (left or right).

   Observation: I am currently in a battle with a wild Weedle.  My Pikachu (Lv 8) is facing a Weedle (Lv 5).

Analysis: The prompt correctly identifies that I'm in a battle and that movement commands are irrelevant until the battle is over.  My immediate priority is to win the battle.  After the battle, I will resume exploring using a horizontal movement (left or right), as per the suggestion in the prompt to try perpendicular direction since previous movements were up and down.

Action: No action needed using `pokemon_controller` yet.  The battle must be resolved first. I will wait for the battle to conclude, then I will resume exploring using a horizontal movement (left or right).

No code is needed at this time.

   Observation: I am currently in a battle with a wild Weedle. My Pikachu (Lv 8) is facing a Weedle (Lv 5).  The available moves are Growl, Tail Whip, Thunder Shock, and Thunder Wave.

Analysis: The Weedle is a low-level Pokémon.  To proceed efficiently, I should defeat it quickly.  Thunder Shock is a super effective move against Bug-type Pokémon like Weedle, and it's likely to be a one-hit KO.

Action: I will use Thunder Shock.  After the battle, I will resume exploring using a horizontal movement (left or right), as per the suggestion in the prompt to try a perpendicular direction since previous movements were up and down.

   Observation: I am in a battle against a Weedle. My Pikachu is poisoned and has 16/24 HP.  The text indicates Pikachu's speed fell.


Analysis: I am currently in a battle, so pressing 'a' to interact with the environment is not appropriate at this time.  The problem statement indicates I've been repeatedly pressing 'a', which is likely related to a previous situation where I was stuck. Since I'm in battle, further exploration is paused.  I need to complete this battle before resuming exploration.  I will continue the battle by selecting an action in the battle menu (presumably by pressing 'a' repeatedly, which is not detailed). I will not output the code for this action since the code's scope doesn't include the battle system.


Action:  The action to take is within the battle; I need to select a move for Pikachu to defeat Weedle. This requires interaction within the battle menu, which is outside the scope of the provided `pokemon_controller`.  Therefore, I cannot provide code for this step.  Once the battle is won, I will resume exploration using the `pokemon_controller`.

   Observation: The battle against Weedle is over. Pikachu won.  The screen shows a message indicating Weedle fainted.  I am in tall grass.


Analysis: The previous turns' repeated 'a' presses were part of the battle sequence.  Now that the battle is concluded, I can resume exploration.  Since the repeated 'a' presses were within the battle and not related to navigation, I will not consider it a failed action in the exploration context. The immediate environment is tall grass, suggesting continued random encounters are possible.  Continuing exploration is the next logical step.  I will choose a direction to proceed.  Let's try moving to the right.
