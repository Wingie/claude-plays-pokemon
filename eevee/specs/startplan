  🚀 Tomorrow's Session Plan - Battle System Refinement

  Priority 1: Battle Detection Reliability

  Issue: AI sometimes uses exploration_strategy even when saying "wild Pokemon battle"
  Tasks:
  - Debug why battle context isn't always passed to detection function
  - Add more specific battle UI indicators
  - Test battle detection with actual game screenshots
  - Implement battle memory (remember we're in battle between turns)

  Priority 2: Move Selection Intelligence

  Issue: AI knows Thundershock > Caterpie but struggles with menu navigation
  Tasks:
  - Map common moves to their typical grid positions
  - Add type effectiveness database to battle template
  - Implement "scan moves first, then select best" strategy
  - Test with actual Pokemon battle scenarios

  Priority 3: Battle State Management

  Issue: AI doesn't track battle progression or health changes
  Tasks:
  - Add battle turn counting and progression tracking
  - Implement health-based decision making (heal, switch, attack)
  - Recognize battle end conditions (victory, defeat, capture)
  - Proper transition back to exploration mode

  Priority 4: API Response Reliability

  Issue: Still getting empty responses (0 length, no reasoning)
  Tasks:
  - Investigate Gemini API timeout/rate limiting issues
  - Test prompt length limits and optimization
  - Add fallback prompts for API failures
  - Debug screenshot + prompt size combinations

  Priority 5: Documentation & Testing

  Tasks:
  - Update CLAUDE.md with new battle system architecture
  - Create comprehensive battle scenario tests
  - Document known issues and workarounds
  - Add battle system troubleshooting guide

🎮 TURN 6: Pressed ['right']
💭 FULL AI REASONING:
   Observation: Pikachu defeated a Caterpie.  The player is in tall grass.

Analysis: Since the previous actions involved mostly 'down' movements and pressing 'a', let's try a horizontal movement to explore a different part of the grass area.  This follows the "Stuck Recovery" strategy of trying a perpendicular direction.

Action: Moving right.

💭 FULL AI REASONING:
   Observation: Pikachu defeated a Caterpie. The player is in tall grass.

Analysis: The previous action was moving right.  Since we are in tall grass and want to explore systematically, a vertical movement (up or down) is a logical next step to explore different parts of the grass area. Let's try moving up.

Action: Moving up.

💭 FULL AI REASONING:
   Observation: Pikachu defeated a Caterpie. The player is in tall grass.  The previous actions involved moving right and then up.  To explore systematically, let's try moving down.

Analysis: We've tried moving right and up.  Since we are still in tall grass, moving down is the next logical step in a systematic exploration of this area.

Analysis: We've tried moving right and up. Since we are still in tall grass, moving left is the next logical step in a systematic exploration of this area.  The user suggested trying horizontal movement instead of down, which aligns with this strategy.

Analysis: We've tried moving right and up. Since we are still in tall grass, moving down is the next logical step in a systematic exploration of this area. The user suggested trying vertical movement instead of continuing horizontal movement, which aligns with this strategy.

🎮 TURN 12: Pressed ['right']
💭 FULL AI REASONING:
   Observation: The player is in tall grass. There is a trainer to the left.  The previous actions involved moving down repeatedly. To explore systematically, let's try moving in a perpendicular direction (right).


Analysis: We've tried moving down multiple times and encountered only wild Pokemon battles.  Since we are still in tall grass, moving right is the next logical step to explore a different part of this area.  This avoids getting stuck in a loop of only encountering wild Pokemon battles.


Action: Moving right.

🎮 TURN 36: Pressed []
💭 FULL AI REASONING:
   Observation: I'm in a battle with a wild Weedle. My Pikachu (Lv 8) is facing it.  The battle is in progress. A critical hit!

Analysis: Since I'm in a battle, movement commands are irrelevant. The battle will proceed automatically. No action is needed from my side. The battle will continue until it ends.

Action: No button press is required. The battle will resolve itself.

Analysis: The battle has concluded successfully.  No button presses are needed at this time. The game should automatically transition back to exploration.

🎮 TURN 38: Pressed ['right']
💭 FULL AI REASONING:
   Observation: The battle is over, and Pikachu gained experience points.  The screen shows Pikachu standing in tall grass.

Analysis: The previous battle has concluded.  No immediate action is required. The game should automatically transition back to exploration mode.  The user has previously instructed to press 'a' to interact with the environment, but that is not relevant during exploration.  The most reasonable action is to continue exploration. I will choose a direction to move. Let's try moving 'right'.

Action: Move right.

print(pokemon_controller(button_presses=['right']))

============================================================
💡 RECOVERY SUGGESTION: Stuck with 1 consecutive ['right'] actions
   Recommended: Try vertical movement instead of right

🎮 TURN 39: Pressed []
💭 FULL AI REASONING:
   Observation: Pikachu is standing in tall grass after a battle with Weedle.  The battle is over, and Pikachu gained experience points.

Analysis: The game is back in exploration mode after the battle. The previous action was to move right, which presumably led to the encounter. Since the user suggested trying vertical movement instead of horizontal, and we previously moved right, we should now try moving up or down.  Let's try moving 'up'.

Action: Move up.

🎮 TURN 40: Pressed []
💭 FULL AI REASONING:
   Observation: The player is in tall grass. A trainer is visible to the left.

Analysis: The previous actions involved moving right and up.  To avoid repeating actions and explore systematically, let's try moving in a perpendicular direction. Since we've moved up and right, let's try moving down. This will allow exploration of a new area while adhering to the systematic approach.

Action: Move down.

🎮 TURN 41: Pressed []
💭 FULL AI REASONING:
   Observation: The player is in tall grass. A trainer is visible to the left.

Analysis: The previous actions involved moving right, up, and down.  The warning message indicates a lack of progress. To break this potential loop and explore systematically, let's try moving left, which is the perpendicular direction to the previous 'right' movement and will allow interaction with the visible trainer.

Action: Move left.

🎮 TURN 42: Pressed []
💭 FULL AI REASONING:
   Observation: The player is in tall grass. A trainer is visible to the left.

Analysis: The user instructed to interact with the environment using the 'A' button.  Given the proximity to the trainer, pressing 'A' might initiate a battle. However, based on the game rules, battles start automatically when approaching a trainer.  Therefore, moving towards the trainer (left) is a more strategic action than pressing 'A'.

Action: Move left.
