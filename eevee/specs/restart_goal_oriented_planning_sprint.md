# Sprint: Goal-Oriented Planning System

## Sprint Overview
**Sprint Goal**: Design and validate a hierarchical goal planning system that can decompose high-level Pokemon objectives into executable subtasks

**Duration**: 2 weeks (Design → Prototype → Test → Refine)

**Success Criteria**: 
- Successfully complete "Heal at Pokemon Center" goal through hierarchical decomposition
- Demonstrate dynamic goal generation based on game state
- Show measurable improvement over flat task execution

## Sprint Backlog

### Week 1: Design & Foundation

#### Day 1-2: Research & Analysis
- [x] Analyze current task execution system
- [x] Document goal hierarchy structure 
- [ ] Study successful game AI planning systems
- [ ] Define goal state machine and transitions

#### Day 3-4: Technical Design
- [ ] Create goal data model (Goal class, relationships)
- [ ] Design goal description language (YAML schema)
- [ ] Plan Neo4j schema extensions for goals
- [ ] Design API changes for run_eevee.py

#### Day 5-7: Prototype Development
- [ ] Implement basic Goal class and hierarchy
- [ ] Create goal parser for YAML definitions
- [ ] Build simple goal executor wrapper
- [ ] Connect to existing task executor

### Week 2: Integration & Testing

#### Day 8-9: Pokemon Center Test Case
- [ ] Define "Heal at Pokemon Center" goal hierarchy
- [ ] Implement goal decomposition for this case
- [ ] Test end-to-end execution
- [ ] Measure success rate and efficiency

#### Day 10-11: Dynamic Goals
- [ ] Implement goal generator based on game state
- [ ] Create goal templates for common scenarios
- [ ] Test goal generation in various game states
- [ ] Validate goal relevance and ordering

#### Day 12-14: Refinement & Documentation
- [ ] Analyze test results and bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize goal selection algorithm
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Create implementation guide

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Goal Hierarchy Depth
**Options**:
- 3 levels: Goal → Task → Action
- 5 levels: Epic → Story → Chapter → Task → Subtask
- Dynamic: Let AI determine appropriate depth

**Recommendation**: Start with 3 levels, expand if needed

### 2. Goal State Persistence  
**Options**:
- Ephemeral: Goals exist only during execution
- Session: Goals persist within a play session
- Permanent: Goals saved across all sessions

**Recommendation**: Session persistence with option to save

### 3. Execution Strategy
**Options**:
- Depth-first: Complete entire branches before moving
- Breadth-first: Work on multiple goals in parallel
- Priority-based: Dynamic selection based on context

**Recommendation**: Priority-based with fallback to depth-first

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Over-engineering**: Keep initial implementation simple
2. **Performance**: Goal planning shouldn't slow decisions
3. **Integration complexity**: Minimize changes to existing systems

### Design Risks  
1. **Rigid hierarchies**: Allow dynamic goal modification
2. **Poor decomposition**: Validate with multiple test cases
3. **State explosion**: Limit active goals to manageable number

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Goal hierarchy can represent Pewter Gym challenge
- [ ] "Heal at Pokemon Center" executes via goal decomposition
- [ ] Goals are tracked in Neo4j with relationships
- [ ] Performance is within 10% of current system
- [ ] Documentation includes examples and best practices
- [ ] Code has appropriate tests and error handling
