- **Loop Detection**: Clean informational alerts without forced action overrides
- **Memory System**: SQLite-based persistence with session isolation

### **2. Enhanced Navigation Knowledge** ✅ **JUST COMPLETED**
- **Transition Building Concept**: AI now understands route gates vs regular buildings
- **Multi-Exit Mechanics**: Clear guidance on north/south carpet directional exits
- **Systematic Exploration**: LEFT/RIGHT exploration strategy to map building interiors
- **Viridian Forest Route**: Specific knowledge for most problematic navigation challenge
- **Strategic vs Reactive**: Emphasis on planning over immediate button reactions

### **3. Battle System Excellence** ✅
- **Type Effectiveness Matrix**: Complete Pokemon type chart with damage calculations
- **Smart Move Selection**: Priority-based decision tree (super effective → neutral → status)
- **Battle Navigation**: Precise button sequences for move selection
- **Strategic Analysis**: Real-time type matching and damage optimization

## 🎮 **Current Navigation Capability**

### **Expected AI Behavior Now**:
```
Turn 1: Enter building (UP at dark rectangle)
Turn 2: Explore room layout (LEFT/RIGHT)  
Turn 3: Find north carpet (movement toward far end)
Turn 4: Exit to Viridian Forest (UP at north carpet)
```

### **Previous Problematic Loop**:
```
Turn 1: UP (enter) → DOWN (exit) → UP (enter) → DOWN (exit) → Repeat infinitely
```

**Root Cause Fixed**: AI now understands transition buildings have multiple directional exits
