## 🧠 AI Learning Pipeline Architecture

### Real-Time Learning Flow

```
1. GAME TURN → Screenshot captured
2. AI ANALYSIS → Gemini analyzes game state and context
3. TEMPLATE SELECTION → AI chooses appropriate template (battle vs navigation)
4. ACTION EXECUTION → Buttons pressed with validation (max 2 buttons)
5. PERFORMANCE TRACKING → Success/failure and stuck pattern detection
6. PERIODIC REVIEW → Every N turns, analyze template performance
7. TEMPLATE IMPROVEMENT → AI generates enhanced templates using Gemini 2.0 Flash
8. REAL-TIME UPDATE → Updated templates immediately available
9. CROSS-SESSION LEARNING → Improvements persist across sessions
```

### Enhanced Stuck Detection Algorithm

```python
def _detect_stuck_patterns_in_turns(recent_turns):
    """4-Type Enhanced Detection System"""
    
    # TYPE 1: Exact consecutive identical button sequences
    # TYPE 2: Oscillating patterns (A→B→A→B cycles)
    # TYPE 3: Multi-button combination repetitions
    # TYPE 4: High directional frequency (same direction dominance)
    
    return comprehensive_stuck_pattern_list
```

### AI-Powered Performance Analysis

```python
def _ai_evaluate_performance(recent_turns, current_turn):
    """Gemini 2.0 Flash Pokemon-Specific Analysis"""
    
    # Uses Pokemon-specific understanding:

    # - Collision mechanics, approach angles, spatial progress
    # - Performance scoring: 0.0-1.0 with Pokemon context
    
    return {
        "performance_score": 0.15,  # for stuck sessions
        "issues": ["trainer_fixation", "corner_trap_syndrome"],
