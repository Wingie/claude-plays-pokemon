**Progress Report: Pok√©mon Gameplay Session**

**1. Current Status & Achievements:**  Pikachu (Lv 6) is engaged in battle with Caterpie (Lv 4). Caterpie's HP is significantly lower than Pikachu's.  Multiple attacks have been executed.

**2. Progress Toward Goal:**  Significant progress has been made in the current battle.  Caterpie is close to defeat.

**3. Key Challenges:**  The provided API lacks functionality to directly select attacks by name or type, requiring reliance on default attack selection or potentially inefficient button sequences.  Game menu navigation details are insufficient for accurate attack selection.

**4. Next Steps & Strategy:** Prioritize defeating Caterpie. Investigate API documentation for enhanced game interaction capabilities, especially for attack selection.  If direct attack selection isn't possible, a more robust strategy involving button presses to navigate attack menus will need to be developed.  Focus on maximizing attack efficiency once improved API control is achieved.
