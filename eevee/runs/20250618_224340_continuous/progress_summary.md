**Total Turns:** 50

**Progress Report: Pokémon Gameplay Session**

**1. Current Status & Achievements:** Successfully navigated to tall grass, initiated and won a battle against a Caterpie (Lv 4) with Pikachu (Lv 6). Pikachu's current HP is low (5/20).

**2. Progress Toward Goal:** Goal partially achieved. One Pokémon battle won.  Further battles needed to fully achieve the goal.

**3. Key Challenges:**  Limited API functionality hinders precise control over in-battle actions (e.g., move selection).  Determining optimal attack strategy based on limited visual information is difficult.

**4. Next Steps & Strategy:** Continue exploring tall grass for wild Pokémon encounters.  If possible, improve API to allow for more precise in-battle commands, focusing on using the most effective moves. Prioritize battles where a clear level advantage exists to conserve Pikachu's HP.  If necessary, strategically retreat from battles if HP is critically low.
