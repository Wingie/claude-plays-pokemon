**Total Turns:** 5

**Progress Report: Pokémon Gameplay Session**

1. **Current Status & Achievements:**  Player is exploring the overworld.  No Pokémon battles initiated yet.


2. **Progress Towards Goal:** Minimal progress.  The player has moved to the right repeatedly, attempting to enter tall grass and encounter a trainer.  However, actions have inconsistently resulted in movement.

3. **Key Challenges Encountered:**  The input commands (`'right'`) are not consistently registering/being processed.  This prevents progress toward encountering Pokémon. The system may have a bug or be unresponsive to the 'right' command.


4. **Next Steps & Strategy:**  Investigate the cause of the unresponsive input.  If the issue persists with 'right', attempt alternative movement commands (e.g., 'up', 'down', 'left') to determine if input is working correctly for other directions.  If input is still unresponsive, external troubleshooting is needed (e.g., check controller connection, restart game/system). Once movement is functional, systematically explore the overworld to locate tall grass and trainers.
