      "ai_analysis": "The screenshot shows a battle between my Pikachu (level 6, 7/20 HP) and a Caterpie (level 4).  My options are Growl, Thundershock, and Tail Whip.\n\nMy next action is to use Thundershock to defeat the Caterpie quickly and efficiently.  Electric attacks are super effective against Caterpie.\n\nTo do this in code, I would need an API call that maps button presses to game actions.  Unfortunately, the provided `pokemon_controller` API only takes button presses as input and doesn't provide a way to select moves strategically based on opponent and Pokemon status.  Therefore, I can only provide a sequence of button presses assuming the 'a' button selects the highlighted option, and that the move selection menu is already open and Thundershock is the highlighted move.\n\n",
