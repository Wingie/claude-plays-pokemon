**Goal:** find and win pokemon battles

**Total Turns:** 5

**Progress Report: Pokémon Gameplay Session**

**1. Current Status:**  The player character is navigating the overworld.  Two consecutive "right" movements resulted in a wild Pokémon encounter (Turn 5 & 6).

**2. Progress:**  The primary goal (finding a Pokémon battle) has been achieved.  The session is now ready to proceed to the next phase: battling the Pokémon.

**3. Key Challenges:**  The agent initially struggled to reliably trigger wild Pokémon encounters despite moving in seemingly appropriate directions. This could suggest issues with action interpretation or the game's encounter mechanics.

**4. Next Steps:**  Initiate the battle sequence and then strategize based on the encountered Pokémon and the player's team.  Further testing of movement and encounter mechanics is also advised.
