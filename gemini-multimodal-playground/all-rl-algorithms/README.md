# All RL Algorithms from Scratch ‚ú®

This repository is a collection of Python implementations of various Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. The *primary* goal is **educational**: to get a deep and intuitive understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood. üß† Due to the recent explosion in the AI domain especially Large Language Models, and many more applications it is important to understand core reinforcement learning algorithms.

**This is *not* a performance-optimized library!** I prioritize readability and clarity over speed and advanced features. Think of it as your interactive textbook for RL.

## Updates:
- **30 March 2025**: Added 18 new algorithms.

## üåü Why This Repo?

- **Focus on Fundamentals:** Learn the core logic *without* the abstraction of complex RL libraries. We use basic libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib, PyTorch) to get our hands dirty. üõ†Ô∏è
- **Beginner-Friendly:** Step-by-step explanations guide you through each algorithm, even if you're new to RL. üë∂
- **Interactive Learning:** Jupyter Notebooks provide a playground for experimentation. Tweak hyperparameters, modify the code, and *see* what happens! üß™
- **Clear and Concise Code:** We strive for readable code that closely mirrors the mathematical descriptions of the algorithms. No unnecessary complexity! üëå

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap: Algorithms Covered (and Coming Soon)

The repository currently includes implementations of the following RL algorithms, with more planned:

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get started:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fareedkhan-dev/all-rl-algorithms.git
    cd all-rl-algorithms
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv-all-rl-algos
    source .venv-all-rl-algos/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
    .venv-all-rl-algos\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Multiprocessing in A3C:** Please run `a3c_training.py` in the terminal instead of the jupyter notebook to avoid any complication from multiprocessing.

## üßë‚Äçüè´ How to Use This Repo: A Learning Guide

1.  **Start with the Basics (`1_simple_rl.ipynb`):** This notebook introduces fundamental RL concepts like states, actions, rewards, and policies.
2.  **Explore Core Algorithms:** Dive into the individual notebooks for Q-Learning (`2_q_learning.ipynb`), SARSA (`3_sarsa.ipynb`), and REINFORCE (`6_reinforce.ipynb`). Understand their update rules, strengths, and limitations.
3.  **Analyze the Code:** Carefully read the code comments, which explain the purpose of each function and variable.
4.  **Experiment!:** This is where the real learning begins. Try these:
    *   Change hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate) and observe the effect on learning curves.
    *   Modify the environment (e.g., change the grid size, add obstacles) and see how the algorithms adapt.
    *   Extend the algorithms (e.g., implement epsilon decay, add a baseline to REINFORCE).
5.  **Tackle Advanced Methods:** Gradually work through the more complex notebooks on DQN (`13_dqn.ipynb`), Actor-Critic (`8_a2c.ipynb`), PPO (`7_ppo.ipynb`), Model-Based RL with PlaNet (`18_planet.ipynb`), and multi-agent learning with MADDPG (`14_maddpg.ipynb`) and QMIX (`15_qmix.ipynb`).
6.  **Run the A3C Implementation:** Due to complexities with multiprocessing in Jupyter Notebooks, the A3C implementation is in `a3c_training.py`. Run it from the command line: `python a3c_training.py`

## üñºÔ∏è What You'll See: Visualizing Learning

Each notebook includes visualizations to help you understand the agent's behavior:

-   **Learning Curves:** Plots of episode rewards, episode lengths, and loss functions.
-   **Q-Table Visualizations:** Heatmaps to visualize Q-values across the state space (tabular methods).
-   **Policy Grids:** Arrows showing the learned policy (action choice) in each state.
-   **More Advanced Visualizations:** Visualizations may depend on each particular algorithm.
