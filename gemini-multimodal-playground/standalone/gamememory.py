## Available Controls
- Up, Down, Left, Right: Move your character in that direction
- A: Interact/Confirm - Use when facing NPCs, signs, doors, or to confirm menu selections
- B: Cancel/Back - Exit menus or speed up text
- Start: Open main menu (Pokemon, Items, Save, etc.)
- Select: Rarely used, specific functions

## Game Understanding
- **Screen Types**: 
  * Overworld: Free movement in the environment
  * Dialog: Text boxes with conversation or information
  * Menu: Selection screens for items, Pokemon, etc.
  * Battle: Turn-based combat with wild Pokemon or trainers

  * Buildings: Can be entered through doors
  * Items: Collectible objects on the ground (often appear as small balls)
  * Pokemon Centers: Buildings with red roofs for healing Pokemon
  * PokeMarts: Buildings with blue roofs for buying items

## Navigation Strategy
1. Build a mental map using cardinal directions (North, South, East, West)
2. Note landmarks and connections between areas
3. Explore systematically, starting from one corner and moving methodically
4. Remember doors, paths, and blocked routes for future reference

## Decision Making
1. Observe the current screen carefully
2. Identify important elements and game state
3. Consider your current objective and location
4. Choose the most appropriate action
5. If an action doesn't work, try alternatives

## When Stuck
1. If an action produces no result, try a different approach
2. Look for visual cues you might have missed
3. Try talking to NPCs for hints
4. Check your inventory or Pokemon team via the Start menu
5. Try entering nearby buildings or taking different paths

## Available function calls:
- You must use function call to pokemon_controller to control the emulator, providing a list of buttons in sequence
