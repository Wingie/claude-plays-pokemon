# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen - Progress Report

**Current Status:** Navigating early battles and aiming to level up the team. Battling a Rattata. Currently on the pokemon selection screen, ready to swap Pikachu for Charmander.

**Recent Actions (Turns 35-44):**

The last ten turns were focused on an encounter with a Rattata. Initially, the bot was stuck in a loop of repeatedly attempting to select Thundershock. This was due to errors in the turn-by-turn reasoning, resulting in failure to track the game's state effectively.  This highlights a need for more robust state management and loop detection. After the loop was broken, the bot has recognized the state of low HP and is attempting to swap pokemon.

*   **Turn 35-43:** Repeatedly attempted to select Thundershock against a Rattata. This action was ineffective.
*   **Turn 44:** Recognized a loop and identified the need to change the pokemon selection. Now planning to swap pikachu to charmander.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   **Rattata Encounter:** Confirmed the presence of Rattata in early game areas.
*   **Available Moves:** Pikachu has Growl, Thundershock, and Tail Whip available early on.
*   **Bug in Reasoning:** Exposed a critical flaw in turn-by-turn reasoning and state management. The inability to detect progress or changes in game state led to a repetitive, ineffective action.
*   **Pokemon Selection:** The pokemon selection menu is understood and the current task is to select a pokemon.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Select Charmander:** Execute the plan to select Charmander to replace Pikachu in battle.
2.  **Continue Grinding:** Continue battling to level up the Pokémon team, focusing on efficient use of offensive moves. Prioritize Pikachu once healed to maximize its Electric-type advantage against early-game Flying and Water types.
3.  **Improve State Management:** Implement a more robust system to track game state (HP, available moves, turn progression, etc.) to prevent repetitive actions.
4.  **Implement Loop Detection:** Develop a method to detect and break out of repetitive action loops.
5.  **Explore Efficient Training Strategies:** Analyze type matchups and location data to optimize training locations and strategies for each Pokémon.

**Challenges & Insights:**

*   **Looping Behavior:** The repeated attempt to select Thundershock reveals a significant vulnerability in the bot's current logic. Future development must address this.
*   **Low HP:** Pikachu is at low health, requiring a swap to a healthier Pokémon to continue training safely. This demonstrates an understanding of basic survival mechanics.
*   **Move Selection Prioritization:** The repeated recognition of Thundershock as the optimal move suggests a rudimentary understanding of move effectiveness, but this needs further refinement.

**Overall Assessment:**

Progress is being made, but the looping issue highlights the need for substantial improvements in state tracking and decision-making logic. Addressing these challenges is crucial for achieving the overall goal of leveling up the Pokémon team. The ability to recognize a Pokemon with low health and attempt to swap Pokemon shows a step in the correct direction.
