# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**  Currently navigating through a forest area, presumably Viridian Forest, in pursuit of Viridian City. The primary objective is to locate the blue-roofed PokeMart within the city.

**Recent Actions (Turns 55-68):**

*   The primary action across the recent turns has been a consistent attempt to move north.
*   Initial attempts to head north were met with an NPC blocking the path.
*   Subsequently, the player successfully entered a forest area and is currently attempting to traverse it northward.
*   Repetitive movement commands suggest a challenging navigation through the forest environment.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Confirmed presence of Viridian Forest as a necessary passage to Viridian City.
*   Encountered obstacles such as obstructing NPCs within the game world.
*   Realized that the path to Viridian City is not a straight line and requires navigating through the forest.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   Navigating the potentially complex layout of Viridian Forest.
*   Avoiding or interacting with any trainers or wild Pokémon within the forest (though no combat has been explicitly stated).
*   Remaining oriented and maintaining consistent northward progress despite visual similarities in the forest environment.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  Continue navigating north through Viridian Forest.
2.  Successfully exit the forest and reach Viridian City.
3.  Upon reaching Viridian City, actively search for the PokeMart distinguished by its blue roof.
4.  Re-evaluate objectives and plan actions to achieve the main goal after locating the desired PokeMart.
