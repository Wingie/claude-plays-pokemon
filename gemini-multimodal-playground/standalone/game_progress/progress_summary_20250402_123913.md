**Current Goal:** find battles to win and learn how to fight

# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Status:** Currently located on Route 1, actively engaging in battles. Initial attempts to navigate Route 1 were proving problematic due to looping behavior. We have now initiated our first battle against a wild Rattata.

## Recent Actions (Turns 25-34)

*   **Navigation (Turns 25-31):** Primarily focused on navigating Route 1 by moving north in search of wild Pokémon encounters. However, simple northward movement resulted in a looping pattern. Adjusted strategy to include left, up, and right movement.
*   **Dialogue Interaction (Turn 32):** Interacted with a message box, advancing the dialogue by pressing "A".
*   **First Battle (Turns 33-34):** Initiated a battle against a wild Rattata. Selected the first attack option (presumably Tackle or Scratch).

## Key Discoveries

*   **Route 1 Looping:** Straightforward directional movement can lead to circular paths on Route 1, hindering exploration. This highlights the need for strategic pathfinding and diverse movement patterns.
*   **Wild Rattata Encounter:** Identified Rattata as one of the wild Pokémon present on Route 1, providing a first combat opportunity.
*   **Battle Initiation:** Successfully initiated a battle encounter and selected an attack move.

## Challenges

*   **Navigation Challenges:** The looping issue on Route 1 required a change in movement strategy.
*   **Lack of Battle Information:** The report indicates only selecting the "first attack option," suggesting a need to better understand attack types, effectiveness, and Pokémon statistics.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Win the Battle Against Rattata:** Continue executing attacks and win our first battle to gain experience and potentially level up our Pokémon.
2.  **Refine Battle Strategy:** Experiment with different attack options to understand their effectiveness and develop a basic combat strategy.
3.  **Explore Route 1 Strategically:** Implement the revised movement strategy (left, up, right) to thoroughly explore Route 1 and discover more wild Pokémon.
4.  **Identify Route Exits:** Locate the exits of Route 1 to progress further into the game.
5.  **Learn More About Battles:** Begin to understand the battle UI, types, and strategies to effectively win.
