# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Unknown location in Viridian Forest, likely near the entrance (Coordinates: 4, 7).
*   **Party:** Pidgey (Level 12, 31/33 HP).
*   **Progress:** Initial exploration stalled due to potentially being stuck in a movement loop. The character is now engaged in a battle.

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 25-34)

*   **Turns 25-26:** Character was in the overworld, but seems to have been stuck in place, possibly due to a bug or pathing issue. The objective was to move north into the tall grass.
*   **Turns 27-34:** Encountered a Caterpie and repeatedly engaged in battle, using Tackle.

## III. Key Discoveries & Analysis

*   **Location Confirmation:** We are likely near the Viridian Forest entrance, close to tall grass.
*   **Enemy Encounters:** Caterpie is a common encounter in the area.
*   **Gameplay Bottleneck:** The character is currently repeating actions (choosing Tackle repeatedly) in the Caterpie battle, indicating a possible loop or failure to progress the battle properly. The coordinates being consistent also indicate the character is unable to progress from the battle.

## IV. Next Objectives

1.  **Break the Battle Loop:** Identify why the battle with Caterpie is not concluding and implement a solution to either win, lose, or escape the encounter. Consider if user-input is required to proceed from the "Fight" menu to selecting the "Tackle" move.
2.  **Tall Grass Exploration:** Once free from the Caterpie battle, continue moving north into the tall grass to search for wild Pokémon, including Pikachu.
3.  **Pikachu Search Strategy:** Implement a strategy for encountering and catching Pikachu (e.g., weakening it and using Poké Balls).
