# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest (Coordinates: 8, 5)
*   **In Battle:** No (is_in_battle = FALSE)
*   **Overall Progress:** Minimal progress made toward leveling up Pokémon due to initial misidentification of game state.

## Recent Actions (Turns 15-24)

*   **Turns 15-19:** Repeatedly pressed "A" attempting to advance text, incorrectly assuming the game was in a battle sequence. This was a waste of turns.
*   **Turns 20-24:** Recognized error in previous turns and corrected state. Began exploring Viridian Forest by moving upwards, focusing on encountering wild Pokémon to level up.

## Key Discoveries & Learnings

*   **Incorrect State Assumption:** The primary challenge was the initial misidentification of the game state, leading to unproductive actions (pressing "A" when not in battle).
*   **Coordinate Awareness:** Gaining awareness of the overworld coordinates (8, 5) allowed for accurate state recognition and a shift to appropriate actions (exploration).
*   **Overworld Exploration:** Moving upward within Viridian Forest is the current strategy for encountering Pokémon and achieving the leveling goal.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Exploration:** Persistently move up within Viridian Forest to maximize opportunities for encountering wild Pokémon.
2.  **Initiate Battles:** Once a wild Pokémon encounter occurs, engage in battle and strategically use moves to defeat the Pokémon and gain experience.
3.  **Monitor Experience:** Track the experience gained by the Pokémon to assess progress towards leveling up.
4.  **Adjust Strategy (If Needed):** If upward movement proves unfruitful, consider alternative exploration directions within Viridian Forest.
