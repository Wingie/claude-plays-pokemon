# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Pikachu Hunt

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Status:** Exploring Viridian Forest. Have engaged in multiple battles with Weedle.  Currently not in battle.

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Recent Actions (Turns 0-9):

The primary activity over the last ten turns has been battling wild Weedle in the tall grass of Viridian Forest.  Each turn has followed a similar pattern:

1.  **Observation:**  The game state is analyzed.  The bot identifies that it is in battle with a Weedle. The lead Pokémon's HP is assessed (and deemed healthy, based on the image analysis assumption). The `pokeball_count` remains unknown.
2.  **Analysis:** The bot determines that a battle is in progress and that the opponent is not a Pikachu.
3.  **Planning:** The bot prioritizes handling battle actions by selecting the "Fight" option and then using the lead Pokemon's first move.
4.  **Action:** The 'A' button is pressed twice, executing the chosen move.

After defeating a Weedle on Turn 8, the game transitioned to the battle summary screen. The bot successfully identified this state and planned to clear the summary screen by pressing 'A'.  This action continued on Turn 9.

## Key Discoveries & Insights:

*   **Location:** We are likely in Viridian Forest, given the presence of Weedle and the stated goal.
*   **Encounter Rate:** Encounters with Weedle appear to be frequent, suggesting that Pikachu, if present, may be rarer.
*   **Battle Strategy:** The current default battle strategy (using the first move) is effective against Weedle but may not be optimal for all encounters.
*   **Post-Battle Handling:** The bot successfully recognized the transition to and handled the battle summary screen.

## Obstacles Faced:

*   **Monotony:** Repeatedly battling the same Pokémon (Weedle) can be time-consuming.
*   **Inefficient Strategy:** The current battle strategy relies on the first move being effective. More intelligent move selection based on opponent type is needed to optimize battles.
*   **Unknown Pokeball Count:** The bot has not yet acquired information about the available Pokeballs, creating a risk of being unable to catch Pikachu if/when it is encountered.

## Next Objectives:

1.  **Continue Exploration:** Proceed further into Viridian Forest, increasing the likelihood of encountering Pikachu.
2.  **Prioritize Pikachu Encounters:** Upon encountering a Pikachu, prioritize capturing it. This will require knowing and using pokeballs.
3.  **Implement Smarter Battle Logic:** Integrate type effectiveness information to select the optimal move during battle and handle other Pokemon aside from Weedle.
4.  **Acquire Pokeball Count:** Read the inventory to determine the amount of pokeballs available.

## Long Term Goals:

* Successfully catch a Pikachu
* Complete the Viridian Forest
