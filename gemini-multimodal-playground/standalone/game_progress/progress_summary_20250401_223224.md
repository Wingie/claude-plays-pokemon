# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Locate the Pokémart with a blue roof in Viridian City.

## Current Status

*   Moving towards Viridian City.
*   Encountered a ledge and a person obstructing the path north.
*   Currently experiencing difficulty navigating around the obstacles.

## Recent Actions

*   Continued moving north after a battle where Charmander gained 32 EXP.
*   Attempted to navigate around the ledge by repeatedly pressing 'left'.
*   After getting stuck in a loop, attempted to break free by pressing 'up' after pressing left.
*   Currently attempting to press left three times, and then up.

## Key Discoveries

*   Obstacles (ledge and a person) block direct northward progress.
*   Navigating around obstacles requires a leftward movement followed by an upward movement.
*   Repeatedly pressing 'left' resulted in getting stuck.

## Challenges Faced

*   Successfully navigating past the ledge and the person blocking the path north.
*   Breaking out of movement loops resulting from repeated actions.
*   Finding an effective strategy to overcome the obstacles without getting stuck.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Execute Strategy:** Complete the planned sequence of three 'left' presses followed by one 'up' press to attempt to bypass the obstacles.
2.  **Evaluate Outcome:** Observe whether the attempted strategy allows forward progress towards Viridian City.
3.  **Adjust Strategy:** If the initial strategy fails, reassess the situation and devise an alternate navigation route. Consider other possible directions or interactions with the environment.
4.  **Locate Pokémart:** Once in Viridian City, search for the Pokémart with the blue roof to advance the story.
