# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Trainer is located in the overworld at position (6, 11), surrounded by tall grass.
*   Main objective: Find and win Pokémon battles to gain experience and learn how to fight.

**Recent Actions (Turns 90-99):**

*   Engaged in and won a battle against a Wild Pidgey (Turn 90-94).
*   Pokémon gained 23 EXP points from the battle.
*   Returned to the overworld after the battle (Turn 95).
*   Repeatedly attempted to trigger new battles by moving within the tall grass surrounding their current location (Turns 95-99).

**Key Discoveries/Observations:**

*   Tall grass is a reliable place to find wild Pokémon battles.
*   "Tackle" appears to be a strong (or the only) attack available.
*   Winning battles grants EXP points.
*   The overworld is navigated by moving between tiles.
*   The location is being saved each turn.

**Challenges/Obstacles:**

*   Looping behavior: Remaining in the same location (6, 11) despite attempting to move, likely due to a lack of specific movement commands or the game not registering the movement attempts. This is causing a repetitive loop of stating the current location and objective without progress.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Break the Loop:** The immediate priority is to break the location loop at (6,11). Strategies should be tested to ensure movement is successfully registered by the game. This might involve:
    *   Trying moving in all 4 directions (North, South, East, West) and verifying if location changes.
    *   Ensuring a clear and explicit movement command is being given each turn.
2.  **Find and Win More Battles:** Once movement is successful, continue exploring the tall grass to encounter and win more battles.
3.  **Level Up and Learn:** Monitor the EXP gained and determine if the Pokémon is leveling up and learning new moves.
4.  **Explore the Surroundings:** Once a sufficient number of battles have been fought, begin exploring the environment beyond the immediate tall grass area. Investigate the line of trees to the East.

**Action Plan:**

For the next turn, focus specifically on executing a single movement command. For example, specifically command "Move North one step" and check for any change in location. If the location remains the same, reassess movement commands.
