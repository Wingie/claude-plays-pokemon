# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 90-99

**Current Goal:** Train Mankey through battles.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, surrounded by tall grass. Exact location is currently unknown.
*   **Party Status:** Mankey is our primary battler. Mankey's health fluctuates, requiring strategic retreats.
*   **Progress:** Minor progress in training Mankey (gained 23 EXP from one battle).

## Recent Actions

*   **Engaged in multiple battles with wild Pidgey.** Primarily focused on leveling Mankey.
*   **Prioritized Mankey's survival:** Fled from battles when Mankey's health was low to avoid fainting.
*   **Explored the tall grass area:** Continuously moved upwards in the overworld to seek out more battles for Mankey.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Pidgey Encounter Rate:** Pidgey appears to be a common encounter in the current location.
*   **Mankey's Vulnerability:** Mankey's relatively low health necessitates strategic battle management, including running from battles.
*   **EXP Gain:** Defeating a Pidgey grants Mankey 23 experience points.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Low Mankey Health:** Mankey's vulnerability to attacks has forced multiple retreats, slowing down the training process.
*   **Repetitive Encounters:** Encountering Pidgey repeatedly, while contributing to experience gain, is not optimal.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Searching for Battles:** Persist in exploring the tall grass to find more battle opportunities for Mankey.
2.  **Consider Alternative Strategies:** If Pidgey encounters remain frequent and Mankey continues to struggle, explore other areas or battle tactics.
3.  **Monitor Mankey's Level:** Track Mankey's experience points and level to gauge training progress.
