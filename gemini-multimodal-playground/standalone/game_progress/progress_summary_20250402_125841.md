# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Game:** Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen

**Progress Goal:** Find and Win Pokémon Battles

## Current Status

The trainer is currently on Route 1, just outside Viridian City. Pidgey is at least level 8. Our Pokemon are fully healed thanks to a visit to the Viridian City Pokémon Center. The primary focus remains on finding and winning Pokémon battles to progress the game.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 35-36:** Engaged in wild Pidgey battles. Pidgey leveled up (exact level unknown).
*   **Turns 37-38:** Navigated the overworld, initially surrounded by trees. Discovered a building (later identified as the Viridian City Pokémon Center) to the north.
*   **Turns 39-43:** Entered the Viridian City Pokémon Center, healed the Pokémon, and prepared to leave.
*   **Turn 44:** Exited the Pokémon Center and entered Route 1. Began exploring the grassy areas in search of Pokémon battles.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Viridian City Pokémon Center:** Discovered and utilized the Pokémon Center for healing services. This is a crucial location for maintaining the Pokémon team's health.
*   **Route 1:** Identified Route 1 as a promising location for finding wild Pokémon to battle, based on the presence of grassy areas.

## Challenges

*   **Navigation:** Initially disoriented in the overworld, requiring careful exploration to locate key landmarks.
*   **Repetitive Actions:** The game often requires repetitive button presses (e.g., advancing dialogue), which can slow down progress.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Engage in Pokémon Battles on Route 1:** Explore the grassy areas of Route 1 to encounter and battle wild Pokémon.
2.  **Level Up Pidgey:** Continue battling to gain experience and level up Pidgey, improving its battle capabilities.
3.  **Explore Route 1 Further:** Investigate the entirety of Route 1 to discover any items, trainers, or other points of interest.
4.  **Potentially Catch New Pokémon:** Consider catching new Pokémon on Route 1 to diversify the team.
