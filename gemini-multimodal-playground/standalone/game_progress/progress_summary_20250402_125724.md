# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on the context)

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

We are currently engaging in repeated battles with wild Pidgey. While we are consistently attacking, the report doesn't indicate the outcome of these battles (win/loss/escape). Progress toward our goal of "finding and winning" is unclear without knowing the result of each encounter.

## Recent Actions (Turns 20-29)

*   **Consistent Action:** Selected the first attack option in ten consecutive encounters.
*   **Enemy Encountered:** Primarily battling wild Pidgey.
*   **Strategy:** Using the first available attack (unspecified).

## Key Discoveries

*   **Pidgey Abundance:** Pidgey are prevalent in the current location, making them a readily available battle target.
*   **Limited Data:** We lack crucial information on the success rate of our attacks and the overall outcome of each battle. We don't know if we are winning, losing, or escaping.
*   **Strategic Uniformity:** The report shows a repetitive attack strategy, indicating a possible need for diversification to optimize battles.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Victory Confirmation:** Determine the outcome of each battle (win, loss, escape). This is crucial for assessing progress.
2.  **Strategic Evaluation:** Evaluate the effectiveness of using the first attack option against Pidgey. Consider exploring different moves or strategies if the win rate is low.
3.  **Resource Management:** If consistently losing or using excessive resources (Potions, PP), consider adjusting strategy or location.
4.  **Explore Alternatives:** If the win rate is too low we may want to explore options other than battling.
5.  **Objective Clarification:** The goal is stated as "find and win pokemon battles." Is there a specific goal like catching them? More detail could lead to more relevant actions.
