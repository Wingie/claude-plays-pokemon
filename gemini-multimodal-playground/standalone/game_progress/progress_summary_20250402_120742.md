# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Train Mankey through wild battles.

## Current Status

*   Exploring an area with tall grass, actively seeking wild Pokémon encounters to train Mankey.
*   Successfully engaged in two wild battles after encountering difficulty navigating the terrain.

## Recent Actions (Turns 20-29)

*   **Turns 20-27:** Initial attempts to move directly up into the tall grass were unsuccessful due to an unseen ledge. This led to a repetitive loop, as the character was blocked. Action taken: Re-oriented movement to the right to circumvent the obstacle and resume the search for encounters.
*   **Turns 28-29:** Successfully initiated two wild battles. The first attack option was selected in both encounters. The outcome of these battles is yet to be determined in the turns we have data for.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Terrain Obstacles:** Uneven terrain (ledges) can block movement in the overworld, requiring alternative routes.
*   **Confirmation of Wild Encounters:**  Movement within tall grass is effective in triggering wild Pokémon battles.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Battle Training:** Focus on winning the current battles to gain experience points for Mankey.
2.  **Explore Further:** After the current battles, continue exploring the tall grass area, potentially moving towards other areas with taller grass to increase encounter frequency.
3.  **Monitor Position:** Pay close attention to the character's position and surrounding terrain to avoid getting stuck in loops caused by hidden obstacles.
4.  **Refine Battle Strategy:** Observe the effectiveness of the first attack option in the current battles. If ineffective, consider trying a different attack to optimize Mankey's training.

## Insights and Strategies

*   **Spatial Awareness:** Paying attention to the minimap or in-game cues about terrain elevation changes is crucial to avoid getting stuck.
*   **Persistent Exploration:** While the initial attempts to move upwards were unsuccessful, persistence in exploring different paths within the tall grass ultimately led to successful encounters.
*   **Basic Battle Strategy:** The initial strategy of using the first attack is a reasonable starting point. The need to optimize this approach will be assessed in subsequent turns based on battle effectiveness.
