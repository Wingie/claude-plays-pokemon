# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## I. Current Status

*   **Pokémon:** We currently have a Pidgey with 11/17 HP.
*   **Location:** We are in the overworld, in tall grass, position (6, 11). Location is currently unknown and needs to be determined.
*   **Progress:** Initial battle experience has been acquired, resulting in a level up (implied, based on EXP gain).
*   **Challenges:** Possible control loop issues encountered requiring manual intervention. Location awareness is low.

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 70-79)

*   **Engaged in multiple battles against wild Rattata (Turns 70-75):** Focused on using Pidgey's Tackle attack repeatedly.
*   **Successfully defeated a Rattata (Turn 75):** Earned EXP. points from the victory.
*   **Overworld Exploration (Turns 77-79):**
    *   Broke out of a potential "stuck" loop by manually inputting a "move up" command.
    *   Explored the overworld, specifically focusing on following the path leading upwards from our current location in tall grass.

## III. Key Discoveries

*   **Tackle is effective against Rattata:** While repetitive, using Tackle proved sufficient to defeat the encountered Rattata.
*   **EXP. Points are awarded for defeating Pokémon:** We gained 24 EXP. points after defeating the Rattata.
*   **Manual input can override potentially stuck behavior:** When the automated "A" button presses resulted in getting stuck, manually inputting movement commands allowed us to proceed.
*   **Path Exists:** We discovered a path leading upward, suggesting a route to further exploration and potential battles.

## IV. Next Objectives

*   **Determine Current Location:** Identify the specific area of the map we are currently in.  Consulting a map or walkthrough may be beneficial.
*   **Continue Upward Exploration:** Follow the upward path to discover new areas, encounter new Pokémon, and gain further battle experience.
*   **Monitor Pidgey's HP:** Keep a close eye on Pidgey's HP to avoid fainting. Consider using items (if available) or retreating to heal if necessary.
*   **Diversify Attack Strategy (Future):** Once new attacks are learned or new Pokémon are acquired, experiment with different attack types for greater battle effectiveness.
*   **Minimize Getting Stuck:** Identify the root cause of the control loop issues and take preventative measures to avoid repeating it. (Consider testing different emulator/controller settings)
