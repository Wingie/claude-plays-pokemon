# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Status:** Traveling north from Pallet Town towards Viridian City. Encounters with wild Pokémon are frequent. Charmander is at level 9.

**Current Goal:** Reach Viridian City and locate the PokeMart with a blue roof. Catch a Pidgey along the way.

## Recent Actions:

*   Repeatedly engaged wild Pidgey in battle.
*   Primarily used Charmander's Ember attack to weaken Pidgey.
*   Consistently chose to continue moving north after battles.

## Key Discoveries and Challenges:

*   **Challenge:** Difficulty catching Pidgey. Repeatedly used Ember which caused the Pidgey to faint, preventing capture.
*   **Location Awareness:** Understanding the need to head north to reach Viridian City.

## Analysis:

The primary obstacle currently is successfully catching a Pidgey. The strategy of using Ember to weaken the Pidgey has consistently resulted in the Pidgey fainting, preventing capture.

## Next Objectives:

1.  **Reach Viridian City:** Continue traveling north to reach Viridian City.
2.  **Locate PokeMart:** Identify the PokeMart with the blue roof in Viridian City.
3.  **Catch Pidgey (Revised Strategy):** Re-attempt to catch a Pidgey. Need to use Scratch more often to avoid the Pidgey from fainting, or catch one with more health.
