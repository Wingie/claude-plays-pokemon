# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore the world until we find a Pikachu.

## Current Status

Currently situated on a rock formation surrounded by grass and other rocks. Progress is stalled due to an inability to navigate off the rock formation.

## Recent Actions (Turns 15-24)

The primary action during the recent turns has been repeated attempts to descend from the rock formation.  Each turn involved observing the immediate surroundings and then attempting to move south (mostly) in hopes of finding a way off.  Variations on this strategy included also trying the left and down directions.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Location:** We are on a rock formation surrounded by grass and other rocks. The area to the north appears to have more rocks. A bush is noted to the southeast in one turn.
*   **Obstacle:** The main obstacle is the inability to navigate off the rock formation. The terrain appears restrictive.
*   **Failed Strategy:**  Repeatedly moving south has not resulted in exiting the rock formation.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Re-evaluate Movement Strategy:** Since repeatedly moving south has failed, we need to re-evaluate our approach. The simple southward movement may not be sufficient to overcome the terrain.

2.  **Explore Alternate Directions:** Instead of just moving south, we should systematically try moving north, east, and west to identify any possible exit points.

3.  **Map the Rock Formation (Mentally):**  Try to develop a mental map of the rock formation. This might involve moving north/south/east/west even if we don't immediately expect to get off. Understanding the layout might reveal a less obvious exit route.

4. **Document exact actions taken each turn.** To ensure we don't keep repeating the exact same movements, we need to document precisely which direction we moved on each turn.

By methodically exploring alternate directions and mapping the rock formation, we hope to overcome this obstacle and resume our exploration for Pikachu.
