# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Head north and find the Poké Mart with the blue roof in Viridian City.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently engaged in a battle with a Rattata.
*   **Party:** Charmander (Level 9, 18/27 HP) is our active Pokémon.
*   **Progress:** Still within the initial area, en route to Viridian City.

## Recent Actions

The last several turns have been consumed by a single, protracted battle against a Rattata. A significant amount of time was spent navigating menus and accidentally opening Pokémon information screens instead of selecting "Fight". The following actions were attempted:

* Repeatedly accessed the Pokémon info screen for Charmander.
* Attempted to choose "CANCEL" on the "Choose POKéMON or CANCEL" screen several times, often needing multiple attempts to correctly select it.
* Finally, returned to the battle screen after several missteps and menu navigations.
* Determined to select "FIGHT" on the next turn.

## Key Discoveries/Insights

*   **Menu Navigation:** The game's menu system requires precise inputs and can be easily misnavigated, especially under pressure (or if not careful). The number of attempts to simply return to the battle after accidentally opening the Pokemon summary screen highlights this challenge.
*   **Rattata Encounters:** Rattata are common early-game opponents.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Successfully execute "FIGHT" command with Charmander in the ongoing Rattata battle.**
2.  **Defeat the Rattata and win the battle.**
3.  **Continue heading north towards Viridian City.**
4.  **Locate the Poké Mart with the blue roof within Viridian City.**

## Strategic Considerations

*   **Focus and Precision:** When navigating menus, it's crucial to pay close attention to the currently highlighted option to avoid accidental selections.
*   **Potion Use (Future):** Once Potions are acquired, strategically use them during battles to maintain Charmander's HP and prevent fainted Pokémon.
