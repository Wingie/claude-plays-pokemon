# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turn 76 - Turn 89

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and find a Pikachu to catch.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian City Pokémon Center (PC).
*   **Party Health:** Lead Pokémon (likely Charmander) at 22/31 HP. Still needs healing, but is at the PC.
*   **Overall Progress:** After struggling in Viridian Forest and sustaining damage in battles, the decision was made to prioritize healing. We have successfully navigated out of the forest and reached the Viridian City Pokémon Center. We are currently interacting with the nurse in a dialog.

## Recent Actions

*   **Navigated out of Viridian Forest:** After a series of battles with Weedle and Pidgey within Viridian Forest, the lead Pokémon's health became dangerously low. We cleared battle summaries, then prioritized exiting the forest to seek healing.
*   **Journey to Viridian City:** Executed a pre-planned route (`down`, `down`, `right`, `right`, `down`, `down` - interrupted at times but continued.) to move from the forest exit to the Viridian City Pokémon Center.
*   **Initiated Healing:** Successfully entered the Viridian City PC and have initiated dialog with the nurse to begin the healing process. We are currently pressing 'A' repeatedly to progress the dialog with the nurse.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Viridian Forest is Dangerous:** Encountered multiple wild Pokémon in the forest, leading to health depletion. Suggests a need for more efficient strategies for exploring and battling or potentially leveling up before further exploration.
*   **Strategic Retreat:** The decision to abandon the search for Pikachu to prioritize healing proved effective. Highlights the importance of recognizing when to disengage and recover.
*   **Multi-Step Movement:** Successfully implemented multi-step movement, though some turns were required for error correction. This will be vital for efficient travel across the world.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Complete Healing:** Continue pressing 'A' to complete the dialog with the nurse and fully heal the Pokémon party.
2.  **Re-enter Viridian Forest:** After healing, we will return to Viridian Forest to resume the search for Pikachu.
3.  **Optimize Exploration Strategy:** Consider strategies to minimize damage taken during exploration, such as using Potions or focusing on avoiding battles until stronger. Potentially consider catching a different pokemon for greater type coverage.
