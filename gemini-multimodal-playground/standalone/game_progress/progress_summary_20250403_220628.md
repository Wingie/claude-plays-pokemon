# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on prompt context)

## Current Status

*   **Location:** In battle.
*   **Primary Goal:** Level up Pokémon.
*   **Critical Issue:** Pikachu's HP is critically low (11/20), triggering `needs_healing = true`. Leveling is temporarily suspended until Pikachu is healed.
*   **Battle Menu:** Visible (`battle_menu_visible = true`, `is_in_battle = true`).

## Recent Actions (Turns 70-79)

*   **Repetitive Attempt to Flee:** Over the last 10 turns, the sole focus has been attempting to run from battles to prioritize healing. The same action sequence (Down, Down, A) has been repeatedly attempted.

## Key Discoveries and Insights

*   **Inconsistent Escape Rate:** The "RUN" command has not been successful in any of the recent attempts. This suggests that the escape rate is not guaranteed and might be influenced by factors like enemy Pokémon level, Speed stats, or randomness.
*   **Immediate Healing Required:** Pikachu's low HP necessitates immediate action. Continuing to battle in this state poses a significant risk of fainting.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Immediate Priority: Successfully Flee Battle.** Continue attempting to use the "RUN" command until successful.
2.  **Heal Pikachu:** Once out of battle, immediately locate a Pokémon Center or use healing items (if available) to restore Pikachu's HP.
3.  **Re-evaluate Leveling Strategy:** After healing, assess the optimal location and strategy for leveling up, considering the risks associated with Pikachu's HP vulnerability. Potentially consider using potions more frequently during training.
