# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore the world and try to encounter a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Unknown, but currently standing in tall grass at coordinates (1, 11).
*   **Party:**
    *   Pidgey: Level 9, 24/27 HP. Has learned Gust.
*   **In Battle:** No
*   **Needs Healing:** No. Pidgey's HP is above 30% of its maximum.

## Recent Actions

Over the past ten turns, the primary activity has been battling wild Pokémon, primarily Rattata, in the tall grass to level up Pidgey. The loop consists of:

1.  Engaging in a battle.
2.  Using Tackle (or similar move) to defeat the opponent.
3.  Exiting the battle end screen by pressing 'A'.
4.  Exiting the level up screen(s) by pressing 'A'.
5.  Moving in the tall grass to trigger another random encounter.

*   **Turn 0-3:** Battled and defeated a Rattata.
*   **Turn 4-5:** Exited the battle screen and leveled up Pidgey to Level 9.
*   **Turn 6-9:** Navigated multiple level up screens where Pidgey learned "Gust" and returned to the overworld in tall grass. Proceeded to move down to potentially trigger another battle.

## Key Discoveries and Insights

*   **Leveling Up:** Pidgey has leveled up to level 9, gaining experience and learning the move "Gust."
*   **Battle Flow:** The battle flow involves multiple screens: the battle screen itself, the "Pokemon fainted" screen, the experience gain screen, and the level-up screen.  Each transition requires pressing 'A'.
*   **Pikachu Elusive:**  Despite searching in tall grass, a Pikachu has not yet been encountered.
*   **Location Ambiguity:** The current location is not explicitly known but is assumed to be near the starting area based on the commonality of Rattata encounters.

## Obstacles Faced

*   **Repetitive Battles:**  Encountering primarily Rattata offers limited experience gain.
*   **Navigation Challenges:** Lack of a clear map or location indicator makes targeted searching difficult.
*   **Level Up Screen Bottleneck:** The Level up screen can be time consuming.

## Strategies

*   **Tackle Spam:** Initially, using "Tackle" repeatedly was effective for defeating low-level Rattata. The plan is now to use gust.
*   **Random Movement:** Moving randomly in tall grass is the primary method for triggering encounters.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Searching for Pikachu:** Prioritize exploring different areas to increase the chances of encountering a Pikachu.
2.  **Level Up Pidgey to Level 15:** Continue grinding in tall grass, but consider seeking out stronger opponents if available to accelerate leveling.
3.  **Explore New Areas:** If Pikachu remains elusive, venture beyond the starting area to discover new routes and Pokémon.
4.  **Identify Current Location:** Determine the exact location to better strategize exploration.
