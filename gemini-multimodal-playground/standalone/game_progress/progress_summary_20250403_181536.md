# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Unknown (likely Route 1 or similar early-game area)
*   **Party Leader:** Pikachu (HP: 14/19)
*   **In Battle:** Yes, repeatedly battling Rattata.
*   **Battle Status:** Maintaining sufficient HP, no immediate need for healing.

## Recent Actions

Over the past several turns, the focus has been on battling wild Rattata to gain experience points.

*   **Turn 0:** Entered a battle against a Rattata.
*   **Turns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7:**  Move selection screen observed.  Initially, the strategy involved selecting "THUNDERSHOCK". Later, due to a lack of knowledge of the available moves' effectiveness, the strategy shifted to simply selecting the first available move ("A").

## Key Discoveries and Challenges

*   **Repetitive Battles:** Encounters are consistently with Rattata, indicating a limited range of available Pokémon in the current area.
*   **Move Selection:** The available moves for Pikachu are "GROWL" and "THUNDERSHOCK". "THUNDERSHOCK" has been initially considered the superior option.
*   **Lack of Information:** There is a recurring issue: lack of information about the effectiveness of available moves against the opponent, forcing the user to select the first available move.
*   **Strategic Shift:** A strategic shift occurred when the user realized that the moveset effectiveness was unknown.

## Next Objectives

*   **Continue Grinding:** Persist in battling Rattata to accumulate experience points and level up Pikachu.
*   **Move Prioritization:** Develop a better understanding of the available moves and their effectiveness against different Pokémon types.  Specifically, determine the type of "THUNDERSHOCK" and "GROWL".
*   **Resource Gathering (Optional):** If possible, attempt to acquire and use items like Potions to sustain battles for longer periods.
*   **Area Exploration:** Explore the current area more thoroughly to discover new Pokémon encounters and potentially progress to the next area.
*   **Learn Rattata's typing:** Ensure a better strategy when picking attacks against Rattata.
