# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

Our trainer is currently engaged in repeated battles with wild Ratata. Our starter Pokémon, Pidgey, is at a low health level (5/15 HP). We are struggling to effectively manage battles and maintain Pidgey's health.

## Recent Actions

*   **Engaged in Multiple Ratata Battles:** We have encountered and battled numerous wild Ratata.
*   **Attempted to Attack:** We have consistently selected the first option in battles, assumed to be the "Fight" option, and chosen the first attack available (presumably "Tackle").
*   **Escaping Considered:** After significant health depletion on Pidgey, there have been attempts to escape from the battle.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Encounter Rate:** Ratata are a very common wild Pokémon in the starting area.
*   **Battle Loop:** We are getting stuck in a loop, seemingly due to repeated selection of the same attack without considering other options.
*   **Health Management Required:** Pidgey's health can deplete quickly, necessitating a strategy for survival beyond simply attacking.
*   **Escaping Battles:** An attempt to escape the battle by pressing "Down + A" on the RUN option was recorded.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Repetitive Gameplay:** The continuous loop of Ratata battles is hindering progress.
*   **Low Health Management:** Failing to manage health has nearly resulted in Pidgey's defeat.
*   **Lack of Strategic Variety:** Relying solely on the first attack option is proving ineffective.
*   **Limited Understanding of Battle Mechanics:** We are not fully utilizing battle options beyond basic attacks.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Prioritize Pidgey's Safety:** Immediately attempt to escape the current battle and heal Pidgey at the nearest Pokémon Center.
2.  **Explore Battle Options:** Investigate and understand all available battle options (Fight, Bag, Pokémon, Run) and their functionalities.
3.  **Strategic Attack Selection:** Learn about different attack types and their effectiveness against various Pokémon.
4.  **Potion Acquisition:** Obtain Potions or other healing items to restore Pidgey's health during battles.
5.  **Diversify Encounters:** Explore different areas within the starting area to encounter new Pokémon.
6.  **Capture a Second Pokemon:** After we have a good understanding of the fighting mechanics, we should capture a second Pokemon to add some diversity to our combat.
