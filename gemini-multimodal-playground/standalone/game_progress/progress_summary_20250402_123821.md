# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Report Date:** Current
**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

The player is currently on **Route 1**, actively searching for battles to gain experience and learn combat strategies. We are in the early stages of the game, focused on understanding core mechanics.

## Recent Actions (Turns 15-24)

*   **Turn 15-16:** Healed Pokémon at the Viridian City Pokémon Center. Dialog was advanced by repeatedly pressing 'A'.
*   **Turn 17:** Exited the Pokémon Center in Viridian City. Initial intention was to head south to find battles.
*   **Turn 18-23:** Traveled north on Route 1, navigating through tall grass, consistently aiming to encounter wild Pokémon or trainers.
*   **Turn 24:** Recognizing a lack of consistent encounters while moving north, a strategy shift was implemented. The player will now move to the right to explore a different part of Route 1 and increase the likelihood of finding battles.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Location:** We have identified and accessed Route 1.
*   **Environmental Factors:** Tall grass on Route 1 increases the likelihood of wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Limited Success:** Simply moving in one direction (north) does not guarantee frequent battles.

## Obstacles Faced

*   **Low Encounter Rate:** Encounters on Route 1 have been infrequent while moving north, hindering the primary goal of gaining battle experience.
*   **Uncertainty:** Inability to predict where battles will occur on Route 1.

## Next Objectives

*   **Exploration:** Systematically explore Route 1 by moving in a different direction (east) to find new areas where Pokémon battles may be more frequent.
*   **Battle Engagement:** Prioritize engaging in any available battles to gain experience and learn combat mechanics.
*   **Adapt Strategy:** Be prepared to adjust the exploration strategy based on the results of moving east. If battles are still infrequent, consider exploring other areas of Route 1 or revisiting Viridian City to gather information.
*   **Trainer Battles:** Actively seek out visible trainers on the route as a more reliable source of battles compared to relying solely on random encounters.
