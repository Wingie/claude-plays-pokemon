# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore the world and try to encounter a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Unknown, but believed to be near Viridian City.
*   **Lead Pokémon:** Pidgey
*   **Pidgey HP:** 15/27 (Critically low - needs immediate healing)
*   **Needs Healing:** YES
*   **Designated Grass Location:** Viridian Forest
*   **Designated Pokémon Center:** Viridian City PC

## Recent Actions (Turns 5-14)

Our recent turns have been dominated by repeated encounters with wild Rattata, coupled with a critical need to heal our Pidgey.  The primary challenge has been escaping battles to reach the Viridian City Pokémon Center.

*   **Repeated Rattata Encounters:** Several turns involved battling wild Rattata. This highlights the high encounter rate of this Pokémon in our current location.
*   **Failed Escape Attempts:**  Initial attempts to flee from battle (Turns 5 & 6) were unsuccessful, potentially due to low speed or game mechanics.  Pressing 'B' for 'RUN' or navigating to 'RUN' and pressing 'A' both failed.
*   **Focus on Offense (Despite Low HP):** Due to the inability to escape, the strategy shifted to defeating the Rattata quickly to end the battle and allow for healing (Turns 7-12).  This was a risky strategy given Pidgey's low HP.
*   **Battle Victory (Turn 13):** Finally, we managed to defeat a Rattata! Pidgey gained 16 EXP.
*   **Navigating to Pokémon Center:**  After finally winning a battle, we are focused on getting our Pidgey healed. Our current coordinates are (2,11). We will need to navigate to the Pokémon Center.

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Rattata Prevalence:**  Rattata appear to be very common in our current area, suggesting this is a good location to level up early-game Pokémon, *if* we could heal easily.
*   **Escape Mechanics:** Running from battle is not always guaranteed to succeed.  Factors like Pokémon speed, opponent speed, or even random chance likely play a role.
*   **Prioritization of Healing:**  Pidgey's consistently low HP underscored the urgent need to reach a Pokémon Center before continuing exploration.  Engaging in further battles in this state is extremely risky.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Reach Viridian City Pokémon Center:** The top priority is to navigate to the Viridian City Pokémon Center at location Viridian City PC and heal Pidgey. This involves exiting the battle summary screen and navigating the overworld.
2.  **Evaluate Current Location:** Once healed, reassess our position and proximity to Viridian Forest (the designated grass location) or other areas where Pikachu might be encountered.
3.  **Consider Team Building:** Now that we have a better understanding of the challenges of our location, and seeing how important it is to keep our Pokemon healthy, consider building a more robust team.
