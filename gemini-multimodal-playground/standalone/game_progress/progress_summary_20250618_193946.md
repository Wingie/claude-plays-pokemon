# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen - Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Level up Pikachu

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Stuck in a battle loop (likely a bug).
*   **Party:** Pikachu (HP: 14/20)
*   **Objective Status:** Blocked - Unable to progress due to the battle loop.
*   **Needs Healing:** Yes. Pikachu's HP is critically low.

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 90-99)

*   Repeatedly attempted to progress the battle after defeating a wild CATERPIE.
*   Due to a probable glitch, the game remained stuck on the move selection screen even after the opponent fainted.
*   The action taken in each turn was consistently pressing 'A' in an attempt to advance the dialogue and exit the battle.

## III. Key Discoveries & Challenges

*   **Battle Loop Bug:** A significant bug has been encountered where the game fails to properly exit a battle after the opponent Pokémon is defeated. This prevents further gameplay.
*   **Pikachu's Vulnerability:** Pikachu's low HP, combined with the battle loop, makes it impossible to heal and potentially puts him at risk of fainting should the battle loop be resolved.
*   **Inability to Execute Plan:** The desired action to exit the battle and heal is currently impossible to execute.

## IV. Next Objectives & Potential Solutions

1.  **Escape the Battle Loop:** The immediate priority is to break free from the battle loop. Potential solutions include:
    *   **Continue Pressing A:** While repetitive, it's possible continued pressing A may eventually advance the dialogue.
    *   **Explore Other Inputs:** Try pressing other buttons (B, Start, Select) in case one triggers a break in the loop.
    *   **Reset Game:** As a last resort, reset the game and reload the last save state. *Important: Make sure a save state exists beforehand.*

2.  **Heal Pikachu:** Once the battle is exited, the next objective is to immediately heal Pikachu at a Pokémon Center.

3.  **Re-evaluate Leveling Strategy:** Once the game can be progressed, a new location to continue leveling Pikachu should be evaluated. If the bug caused repeated battles with weak pokemon it may be wise to relocate.
