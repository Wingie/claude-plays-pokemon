# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

Our Pidgey is now Level 5 and has learned the move SAND-ATTACK. We are currently in the overworld at position (5, 11), situated at the edge of a forested area. Progress is slow, likely due to deliberate pacing to document each step.

## Recent Actions (Turns 90-99)

*   **Turns 90-95:** Successfully defeated a Wild Pidgey. Pidgey gained EXP, leveled up to Level 5, and learned the move SAND-ATTACK. These turns involved repeatedly pressing 'A' to advance through the post-battle sequence.
*   **Turns 96-99:** Exited the battle sequence and returned to the overworld. Currently at coordinates (5,11). Focused on identifying surroundings and reiterating the objective to find battles. Decided to move north to explore the opening and seek wild Pokémon encounters. Movement not yet executed.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Battle System:** Gained experience in the battle system, observing EXP gain and leveling up.
*   **Move Learning:** Pidgey learned the move SAND-ATTACK, providing a new tactical option.
*   **Navigation:** Located ourselves at coordinates (5,11) near a forested area, with an opening to the north.
*   **Overworld Exploration:** Understanding the environment, realizing that upward movement leads to a potentially new area.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Move North:** Execute the planned movement north to explore the opening and potentially trigger wild Pokémon encounters.
2.  **Engage in Battles:** Continue seeking out battles with wild Pokémon to further level up Pidgey and learn more moves.
3.  **Strategic Move Usage:** Experiment with using SAND-ATTACK in battle to observe its effects on opponent accuracy.
4. **Cartography** Begin to mentally map the world to avoid getting lost.

## Challenges & Insights

*   **Repetitive Actions:** The need to repeatedly press 'A' during the post-battle sequence highlights a potentially tedious aspect of the game.
*   **Slow Exploration:** The documented deliberate pacing is preventing faster progress, but can be good for beginners.
*   **Strategic Importance of Moves:** Learning SAND-ATTACK suggests that status-altering moves can play a crucial role in battles. Further observation is needed to understand its effectiveness.

## Future Plans

*   Explore the surrounding areas to identify different types of Pokémon and potential training grounds.
*   Develop a battle strategy based on Pidgey's strengths and weaknesses, incorporating the new move SAND-ATTACK.
*   Document the effectiveness of SAND-ATTACK and other moves in future battles.
