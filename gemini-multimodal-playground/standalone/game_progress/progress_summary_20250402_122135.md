# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report (Turns 90-99)

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on prompt creation date)

## Current Status

*   **Objective:** Train Mankey to a higher level.
*   **Location:** Overworld, surrounded by tall grass (Route unknown).
*   **Team Status:** Mankey is the active Pokémon. Mankey's health is currently unknown, but was recently low (11/17).

## Recent Actions (Turns 90-99)

*   **Turns 90-92:** Repeatedly encountered wild Pidgey. Attempted to flee battles due to Mankey's low health. Running was the chosen tactic.
*   **Turn 93-94:** Successfully defeated a wild Pidgey. Mankey gained 23 EXP. The battle victory confirmed that the objective is possible
*   **Turns 95-99:** Navigating the overworld (tall grass) in an attempt to initiate more battles and gain further EXP for Mankey. Primarily moving upwards.

## Key Discoveries and Observations

*   **Enemy:** Pidgey is a common wild Pokémon in the current area.
*   **Challenge:** Mankey's low health makes prolonged battles risky, necessitating frequent attempts to flee.
*   **Progress:** Gained a small amount of EXP from defeating a Pidgey.
*   **Strategy:** Running from battle isn't ideal for leveling, but necessary for Mankey's survival at current health levels.
*   **Environment:** Current location is characterized by tall grass, conducive to wild Pokémon encounters.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Prioritize Healing:** Before engaging in further battles, seek a method to heal Mankey. This could involve using Potions (if available) or returning to a Pokémon Center (location currently unknown).
2.  **Optimize Training Location:** Continue exploring the current area (tall grass) to find more battles, but consider exploring other areas if Pidgey prove to be too weak or fleeing from battle is always necessary.
3.  **Aggressive Training:** Once Mankey is at full health, engage in as many battles as possible to gain EXP quickly.

## Risks and Considerations

*   Repeatedly running from battles results in inefficient training.
*   Continually encountering the same weak Pokémon (Pidgey) might not be the fastest way to level up.
*   Lack of information about the current location and available resources hinders strategic decision-making.
