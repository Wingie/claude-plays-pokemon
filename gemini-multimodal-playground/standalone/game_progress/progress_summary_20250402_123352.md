# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 75-84

## Current Status

Currently located in an area with tall grass, which triggers wild Pokémon battles. Our primary goal remains to gain battle experience and learn effective fighting strategies. We have encountered a series of battles with Pidgey. One of our Pokémon, Pidgey, has fainted and we are preparing to send out Charmander.

## Recent Actions

* **Turns 75-76:** Navigated through tall grass, attempting to initiate battles. Repeatedly moved right to trigger encounters.
* **Turns 77-81:** Engaged in multiple battles against wild Pidgey. Consistently attempted to attack by pressing 'A'.
* **Turn 82:** Acknowledged a "Use next POKéMON?" prompt, indicating the active Pokémon had fainted. Prepared to switch to another Pokémon.
* **Turn 83:** Acknowledged the fainted Pidgey. Navigated the "Choose a POKéMON" screen and selected Charmander.
* **Turn 84:** Acknowledged the fainted Pidgey and the "Do what with this POKéMON?" prompt. Selected "SEND OUT" for Charmander.

## Key Discoveries

* **Battle Trigger:** Walking in tall grass reliably triggers wild Pokémon battles.
* **Enemy Consistency:** The most frequent encounter is with Pidgey.
* **Fainting Consequences:** When a Pokémon faints, the game prompts for a replacement Pokémon to be sent out.
* **Pokemon Selection:** The game presents a menu to choose which Pokémon to use after one faints.

## Challenges Faced

* **Repeated Encounters:** Battles have been consistently against the same Pokémon (Pidgey), limiting the variety of experience.
* **Fainting:** One of our Pokémon (Pidgey) fainted, indicating a need for better battle strategy or stronger Pokémon.

## Next Objectives

1. **Deploy Charmander:** Successfully send out Charmander into battle.
2. **Refine Battle Strategy:** Experiment with different attack options to improve battle effectiveness, instead of just spamming "A".
3. **Explore Environment:** If Pidgey battles become too frequent, consider exploring other areas to encounter different Pokémon and gain more diverse experience.
4. **Monitor Pokémon Health:** Pay close attention to Pokémon health during battles to avoid further faints and potential setbacks.
