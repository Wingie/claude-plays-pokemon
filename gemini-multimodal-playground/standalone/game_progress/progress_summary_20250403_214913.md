# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen - Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon

## Current Status

*   **Location:** In Battle
*   **Opponent:** Rattata (Paralyzed)
*   **Lead Pokémon:**
    *   HP: 11/19
*   **Battle Menu:** Visible ("FIGHT", "BAG", "POKEMON", "RUN")
*   **Move Selection:** Not Active

## Recent Actions (Turns 22-31)

The last ten turns have been characterized by a state of repetition within a battle. Each turn, the same scenario presents itself: the battle menu is visible with the options "FIGHT," "BAG," "POKEMON," and "RUN," while facing a paralyzed Rattata.

The consistent analysis each turn has been the same: "I am in battle. The battle menu is visible. I should select 'FIGHT' to choose a move." This has led to the consistent plan to press "A" to select "FIGHT".

Essentially, for the last ten turns, the game seems to be stuck in a loop, presenting the battle menu without advancing to the move selection screen.

## Key Discoveries/Observations

*   **Stuck in Battle Menu Loop:** The primary discovery is the inability to progress beyond the initial battle menu screen. The game repeatedly shows the "FIGHT," "BAG," "POKEMON," and "RUN" options, even after repeatedly planning to select "FIGHT."
*   **Opponent Status:** The opponent Rattata is paralyzed, but this hasn't affected the progression issue.
*   **Lead Pokémon Health:** The lead Pokémon's health is at 11/19, indicating that some damage has been taken previously, but no damage has been taken in the past ten turns.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Battle Menu Lock:** The primary challenge is the inability to proceed from the battle menu to the move selection screen. This prevents making any meaningful actions.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Investigate the Battle Menu Lock:**  The primary focus is understanding why the game is failing to advance beyond the battle menu. Is the "A" button input not being registered? Is there an underlying game state issue?
2.  **Troubleshooting:**
    *   **Try other Battle Menu Options:** Attempt selecting "BAG," "POKEMON," or "RUN" to see if any of these options work and can bypass the lock. If "POKEMON" works, try switching out the lead Pokémon. If "RUN" works, flee the battle and see if the game resumes normally.
    *   **Reset the Game (If Necessary):** As a last resort, consider resetting the game (soft reset or restarting the emulator) and reattempting the battle to rule out a potential glitch.
3.  **If Possible, select "Fight" and continue to level up the Pokemon**
