# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest (Coordinates: 7, 5)
*   **State:** Currently engaged in a battle with a Weedle. The game is stuck in a dialog state before the battle menu appears.
*   **Lead Pokémon Health:** Unknown
*   **Healing Status:** Not currently needed.
*   **Explored Areas:** No new areas explored.

## Recent Actions

The primary action taken over the last several turns has been attempting to advance the in-battle dialog by pressing the "A" button. However, the game remains stuck in the dialog state.

*   **Turns 5 & 6:** Initial state recognition and planning to advance dialog, and then move to find more battles.
*   **Turns 7 - 14:** Repeated attempts to advance the dialog by pressing "A". No change in game state.
*   **Turns 10 - 14:** Repeatedly pressing A in response to the unchanging Dialog screen.

## Key Discoveries

*   Confirmed location in Viridian Forest at coordinates (7, 5).
*   Encountered a Weedle in battle.
*   Identified a persistent issue: the game is stuck in a dialog state, preventing access to the battle menu.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Stuck Dialog:** The most significant challenge is being unable to progress past the battle dialog. This prevents any further action in the battle, and therefore any progress towards our goal of winning battles.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Resolve Dialog Issue:** Investigate and attempt alternative methods to resolve the stuck dialog state. This may involve trying different button presses, consulting external resources for known bugs, or resetting the game (if necessary as a last resort).
2.  **Engage Battle Menu:** Once the dialog is resolved, access the battle menu and choose an appropriate attack.
3.  **Win the Battle:** Defeat the Weedle.
4.  **Continue Exploring Viridian Forest:** After winning the battle, continue exploring the tall grass in Viridian Forest to encounter and battle more Pokémon.
