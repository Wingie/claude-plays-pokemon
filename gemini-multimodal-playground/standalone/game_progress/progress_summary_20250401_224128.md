# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

## Current Status

We have successfully reached Viridian City!  Our immediate goal is to explore the city and catch a Pidgey.

## Recent Actions (Turns 24-33)

Our recent turns have been focused on navigating from the grassy route north into Viridian City. We successfully moved north, entering the city limits. Upon entering Viridian City, we encountered an apparent movement loop, repeatedly seeing the city's introductory message. To break the loop, we deviated from the northern path and attempted to move right.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

*   **Turns 24-28:** Consistent movement North to reach and enter Viridian City.
*   **Turns 29-32:** Repetitive "Viridian City" intro message and attempted movement north. Suspected movement loop.
*   **Turn 33:**  Attempted to break the loop by moving right instead of north.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Viridian City:** We have successfully arrived in Viridian City, described as "The Eternally Green Paradise".
*   **Movement Loop:** Encountered a suspected movement loop immediately upon entering Viridian City, preventing further progress north.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Movement Loop in Viridian City:** An unexpected movement loop prevented us from initially progressing north within Viridian City. This highlighted the need for flexible navigation strategies.

## Strategies and Analysis

*   **Northward Movement:** Initially successful in traversing the route to Viridian City.
*   **Breaking the Loop:** Attempting to break the movement loop by changing direction (moving right). It remains to be seen if this will be successful.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Break the Loop:** Determine the cause of the movement loop and find a solution to progress north. Our current strategy is to move right.
2.  **Catch a Pidgey:** Once the movement issue is resolved, prioritize locating and attempting to catch a Pidgey. This will likely involve exploring the grassy areas within or around Viridian City.
3.  **Explore Viridian City:** Thoroughly explore Viridian City for points of interest, NPCs, and potential side quests.
