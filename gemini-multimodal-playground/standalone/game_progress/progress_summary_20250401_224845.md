# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen - Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore the area and catch some Pokémon.

**Current Status:**

*   Charmander is currently healed and ready for battle.
*   We are back in the starting area, ready to resume exploring and catching Pokémon.
*   Have not yet successfully caught any Pokémon.

**Recent Actions & Narrative:**

Our initial attempts to catch Pokémon have been challenging. We immediately encountered a Pidgey.
We engaged in battle with a Pidgey, attempting to weaken it.
We tried using Ember, which was effective, and Growl to lower its attack.
However, Charmander's low health became a significant obstacle.
We ran out of potions and were unable to heal Charmander during battle.
Ultimately, Charmander fainted in multiple encounters with a Pidgey before we could successfully catch it.

After several failed attempts and multiple knockouts, we returned to the Pokémon Center to heal Charmander.
We rested at the Pokémon Center, fully restoring Charmander's health.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Ember is super effective against Pidgey.
*   We need a reliable healing strategy, specifically potions, to sustain battles long enough to catch Pokémon.
*   Running away from a battle after your only pokemon faints is a difficult problem.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Low Health:** Charmander's low health at the beginning of the game makes it difficult to withstand multiple attacks.
*   **Lack of Potions:** The absence of potions or other healing items severely limited our ability to prolong battles and weakened Pokémon to catch.
*   **Running from battle**: The game does not clearly explain how to run from battle.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Acquire Potions:** Prioritize obtaining potions to heal Charmander during battles. Explore the starting town for a PokeMart or other sources.
2.  **Catch Pidgey/Other Pokémon:** Return to the starting routes and focus on catching Pidgey or other common Pokémon to build a team. Use Ember and Growl strategically, and throw Poké Balls when the target's health is low.
3.  **Explore the Area:** Once we have a reliable team with healing options, resume exploring the surrounding area to discover new locations and Pokémon.
