# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find a Pikachu.

**Current Status:**

The player character is currently located in a small grassy area. The immediate surroundings are characterized by:

*   **North:** Rocks blocking further northward movement.
*   **East:** A fence restricting eastward exploration.
*   **West & South:** More grassy area, initially thought to be explorable.

**Recent Actions (Turns 0-9):**

*   Repeatedly attempted to navigate north, west, and south within a seemingly limited grassy area.
*   Experienced a looping issue, where directional movement resulted in no change in position or location description for several turns.
*   Acknowledged the looping problem and recognized the need to change direction.

**Key Discoveries & Observations:**

*   **Limited Exploration Area:** The initial grassy area is smaller than anticipated, with natural barriers (rocks and fences) severely restricting movement.
*   **Looping Issue:** The game's movement mechanics are potentially causing the player to get stuck in a repeating pattern, with no real progress made.
*   **Confirmed Blocked Paths:** It has been confirmed that southward and westward movement are currently blocked, although the initial description suggested otherwise.

**Failed Strategies:**

*   Persistent exploration of the grassy area through north, west, and south directions has proven ineffective.

**Next Objectives & Strategies:**

1.  **Break the Loop:**  Since moving north, south and west have been exhausted, the immediate priority is to move *east*, towards the fence. Despite the presence of the fence, it's possible there might be an opening or a path along it that has been overlooked. This is the only remaining option based on the described surroundings.
2.  **Re-evaluate the Environment:** If moving along the fence also proves fruitless, a full re-evaluation of the environment is needed. This includes considering if the 'rocks' or 'fence' can be interacted with in some way (e.g., using an item).
3.  **Document Actions:** More careful documentation of actions and immediate outcomes is needed to identify patterns and potential triggers for the looping behavior.
4.  **Consider Prior Steps:** Could there be a location prior to the current area that needs to be revisited? Was an item missed?
