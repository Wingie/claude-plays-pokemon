# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest

**Current Status:**

*   Location: Viridian Forest
*   Goal: Catch a Pikachu
*   Situation: Currently engaged in repetitive battles with Kakuna.

**Recent Actions (Turns 5-14):**

*   **Turn 5:** Detected coordinates (7, 5) outside of tall grass. Initiated movement plan to reach tall grass at approximate location (3, 4).
*   **Turns 6-14:** Repeatedly encountered Kakuna in battle. Continuously selected the first available attack move ('A' button). No progress towards catching Pikachu. Coordinates could not be checked during these turns.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Viridian Forest contains Kakuna.
*   Movement towards tall grass resulted in immediate and repeated battles.
*   No information is available on the effectiveness of the selected attack move against Kakuna, nor the party's current Pokemon and their movesets.
*   Coordinate detection is inconsistent.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Repetitive Encounters:** Encounters with Kakuna are frequent, stalling progress towards finding and catching a Pikachu.
*   **Lack of Information:** Limited knowledge of Pokémon types, move effectiveness, and available movesets hinders strategic decision-making in battles.
*   **Coordinate tracking:** Loss of tracking after a battle ensues.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Prioritize Obtaining Information:** Identify and acquire information on available Pokémon moves, their types, and type advantages. This information is crucial for efficient battles. Determine what our Pokemon party looks like, and their moves.
2.  **Battle Efficiency:** Analyze Kakuna's weaknesses and select appropriate moves to defeat it quickly, minimizing the number of turns spent in battle.
3. **Explore Viridian Forest Efficiently**: Implement a more efficient search pattern within the tall grass. Potentially move to a different area within the forest if Kakuna encounters remain excessively frequent. This is difficult to assess without tracking.
4. **Capture a Pikachu:** Once battles become more manageable, focus on encountering and catching a Pikachu. Have Poke Balls ready.

**Revised Strategy Notes:**

*   The initial strategy of blindly navigating to the grass and hoping for a Pikachu encounter needs refinement. The constant Kakuna battles are a significant obstacle.
*   Information gathering is paramount. Before continuing, we need to know more about our Pokémon and their capabilities.
*   Given the lack of information about the player party, consider that the "first" move may not always be the best or most effective.
*   When we are not in a battle, we should be requesting coordinates.
