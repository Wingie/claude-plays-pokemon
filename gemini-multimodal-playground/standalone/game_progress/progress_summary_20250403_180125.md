# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest

**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest, near coordinates (4, 7). Specific location within the forest remains unknown.
*   **Party:** Pidgey (Level 12, 31/33 HP)
*   **Current Activity:** Battling wild Pokémon in an attempt to find and catch a Pikachu.

## Recent Actions (Turns 20-29)

Our initial turns (20-26) were plagued by a suspected movement loop. The game state repeatedly showed the player character outside of tall grass, despite attempts to enter it. This was likely due to incorrect coordinate data. Actions were taken to move into the tall grass to attempt to trigger a battle.

Subsequent turns (27-29) have initiated a wild Pokémon battle. The opponent is a Caterpie. Pidgey is currently engaged in battle and healthy. The strategy employed is to use Tackle.

## Key Discoveries & Observations

*   **Movement Loop Issue:** We experienced a persistent issue where the game state incorrectly indicated the player was not in tall grass, leading to repetitive movement attempts.
*   **Viridian Forest Encounters:** Wild Caterpie have been encountered.
*   **Coordinate Information:** Coordinates are not changing and are not precise. It's not clear how to accurately track the character's position within Viridian Forest.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Movement/Coordinate Errors:** The primary challenge is the persistence of inaccurate coordinate and location information.
*   **Pikachu Elusiveness:** Pikachu has not been encountered yet. Caterpie is a common encounter.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Battling:** Pidgey is currently in battle. Continue using Tackle until the Caterpie is defeated.
2.  **Address Movement/Coordinate Errors:** Refine the movement and coordinate system to ensure accurate location detection. Prioritize getting the character consistently into and moving within the tall grass. This is critical for encountering Pokémon.
3.  **Prioritize Tall Grass:** Focus exclusively on exploring the tall grass areas of Viridian Forest to increase the chances of encountering a Pikachu.
4.  **Monitor HP:** Continuously monitor Pidgey's HP and use items as needed to prevent fainting.
5. **Catch Pikachu:** If a Pikachu is encountered, try to catch it.
