# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon.

## Current Status

The team is currently in a precarious situation. Pikachu's health is consistently low (around 11/20 HP), indicated by `needs_healing = true`.  We are repeatedly encountering battles where immediate healing or escape is necessary.  We are currently stuck in a loop of encountering battles and attempting to run.

## Recent Actions

For the past several turns (turns 75-84), the primary action has been attempting to flee from battles. The strategy consistently involves:

1.  Navigating the battle menu.
2.  Selecting the "RUN" option (two presses of the Down button).
3.  Confirming the selection (pressing A).

However, these attempts to flee have not been consistently successful.

## Key Discoveries & Challenges

*   **Low Health Critical:** Pikachu's consistently low health is a significant impediment to progress. This necessitates either frequent healing or avoidance of battles, both of which are proving difficult.
*   **Escape Failure:** The "RUN" command has not been reliably effective, leading to a frustrating loop of battles. It is unclear if this is due to low Pokémon level, a specific enemy ability, or random chance.
*   **Resource Depletion (Implied):** Although not explicitly stated, the constant need for healing strongly implies a depletion of healing items (Potions).

## Next Objectives

Given the current situation, the immediate priorities should be:

1.  **Secure Healing:** The *very* first action must be to heal Pikachu. This means accessing the inventory and using a Potion (if available) or returning to a Pokémon Center. We need to verify we even *have* healing items.
2.  **Evaluate Escape Options:** If healing items are depleted, we must find a safe route back to the nearest Pokémon Center. If "RUN" continues to fail, consider strategies to defeat low-level wild Pokémon to gain experience and potentially level up Pikachu, making escape easier in the future.
3.  **Level-Appropriate Grinding:** Once Pikachu is at full health, find a suitable area to grind experience against Pokémon that are neither too weak nor too strong, and where escape is more readily achieved.
4.  **Item Acquisition:** If possible, explore areas for free items or find a shop to replenish healing supplies.

The repeated failures to escape suggest a fundamental problem that needs to be addressed *before* focusing on the primary goal of leveling up. Without a stable strategy for survival, progress will be impossible.
