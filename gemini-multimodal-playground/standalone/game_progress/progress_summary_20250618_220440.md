# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently engaged in a Pokémon battle.
*   **Battle Status:** In battle with a HEEDLE.
*   **Lead Pokémon:** Mankey
*   **Mankey's HP:** 20/26 HP
*   **Available Moves:** Scratch, Leer, Low Kick

## Recent Actions (Turns 45-54)

*   **Repeatedly Selecting Scratch:** Over the past several turns, the primary action has been repeatedly attempting to use the "Scratch" move against the opponent HEEDLE. This suggests a strategy of using direct damage.

## Key Discoveries & Observations

*   **Stuck in a Loop?** The consistent repetition of the same action (selecting Scratch) across multiple turns raises concerns. The system may be stuck or not correctly registering actions.
*   **HEEDLE's Attack:** The opponent HEEDLE has used "POISON STING", causing damage to Mankey. This shows the opponent is actively using moves.
*   **HP Depletion:** Mankey's HP has decreased from 23/26 to 20/26, confirming damage is being received from the opponent.  This confirms the battle *is* progressing, even if the bot's actions are being repeated.
*   **Limited Move Variety:** Only using scratch when other moves are available, is a cause for concern. Other moves, like Leer or Low Kick could be more effective in the long run.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Investigate Action Loop:** Immediately diagnose why the "Scratch" move is being repeatedly selected despite multiple turns passing. It is crucial to determine if this is a system malfunction.
2.  **Implement Move Variety:** If not a system error, reconsider the battle strategy. Explore using other moves besides "Scratch."  "Leer" could lower the opponent's defense, potentially making "Scratch" more effective later. "Low Kick" may be super effective against certain Pokémon types, and is worth exploring.
3.  **Monitor HP Closely:** Given that Mankey is taking damage, closely monitor its HP to avoid fainting.
4.  **Consider Escape:** If the battle proves too difficult and Mankey is in danger, explore options for escaping the battle. (Though the current data doesn't show an "escape" option.)
5.  **Win the Battle:** The ultimate goal is to defeat the current opponent, HEEDLE.
