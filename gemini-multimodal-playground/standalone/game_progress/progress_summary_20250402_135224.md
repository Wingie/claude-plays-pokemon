# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen - Progress Report: Viridian Forest Pikachu Hunt

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on conversation context)

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest (coordinates approximately (2, 11), standing near tall grass)
*   **Objective:** Find and catch a Pikachu.
*   **Pokémon Health:** All party Pokémon appear to be healthy and do not require healing.
*   **Progression:** Currently wandering in and near the tall grass of Viridian Forest. No Pikachu encountered yet.

## II. Recent Actions

*   **Exploration:** Multiple turns spent moving randomly within and near the tall grass of Viridian Forest. The specific coordinates fluctuate slightly, suggesting actual movement is occurring.
*   **Battles:** Frequent battles with common Viridian Forest Pokémon (specifically mentioned: Pidgey).
*   **Leveling:** Pidgey has leveled up to Level 10 as a result of recent battles.
*   **Summary Screen Handling:** Consistently exiting battle summary screens after each battle.

## III. Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Confirmed Location:** The Agent is successfully located in Viridian Forest.
*   **Tall Grass Mechanics:** Understanding that moving in tall grass triggers wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Battle Summary:** Efficiently handles the battle summary screen exits.
*   **Coordinate awareness:** Agent is aware of its coordinates, but isn't using them to improve exploration.

## IV. Challenges & Obstacles

*   **Pikachu Elusiveness:** Despite multiple encounters in the tall grass, a Pikachu has not been found. This indicates Pikachu may be a rarer spawn.
*   **Random Movement Inefficiency:** Purely random movement is inefficient. It can lead to wandering in circles, rather than systematically exploring the entire area of tall grass.

## V. Next Objectives & Strategies

*   **Continued Pikachu Hunt:** Persist in exploring the tall grass in Viridian Forest. Pikachu is the primary goal.
*   **Refine Movement Strategy:** Consider implementing a more structured movement pattern, such as moving in rows or columns, to ensure comprehensive coverage of the tall grass area. Instead of moving randomly, consider using a snake-like pattern.
*   **Optimize Encounter Rate:** Continue to trigger battles by moving through the tall grass.
*   **Capture Preparations:** Ensure Poké Balls are available for when a Pikachu is finally encountered.
*   **Monitor Pokémon Levels:** Observe leveling progress, as higher-level Pokémon may aid in capturing Pikachu.
*   **Consider Route Planning:** If initial exploration proves unfruitful, evaluate whether a different section of Viridian Forest should be explored.
