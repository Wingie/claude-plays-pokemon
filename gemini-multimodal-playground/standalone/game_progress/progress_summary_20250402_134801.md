# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on provided turn data)

**Current Goal:** Explore the world and try to encounter a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Approaching Viridian City Pokémon Center.
*   **Party Leader:** Pidgey (15/27 HP - *Needs Healing*)
*   **Designated Locations:**
    *   Grass: Viridian Forest
    *   Pokémon Center: Viridian City PC
*   **Status:**  Approaching the Viridian City Pokémon Center to heal Pidgey. We are currently outside the building and one step away from entering.

## II. Recent Actions & Progress (Turns 12-21)

The primary focus of the last several turns has been navigating to the Viridian City Pokémon Center to heal Pidgey after a battle with a wild Rattata.

*   **Turn 12-14:** Continued struggling against a Rattata, emerging victorious but with severely damaged Pidgey (15/27 HP).  Confirmed the need for immediate healing (`needs_healing = True`). Received EXP for Pidgey.
*   **Turn 15-17:** Discovered being in tall grass was hampering progress.  Began navigating *out* of the grass and oriented towards what was presumed to be the Pokémon Center, moving up and left.
*   **Turn 18-21:**  Confirmed the proximity to the Pokémon Center building. Corrected movement to go *left* towards the building and initiated the action to move *up* and enter it.
## III. Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Prioritization of Healing:** The low HP of the lead Pokémon has dominated the gameplay loop.  The `needs_healing = True` flag is driving the decision-making process.
*   **Navigation Challenges:** The initial uncertainty about the player's location and the Pokémon Center's exact location created navigation challenges.  The environment awareness is gradually improving.
*   **Understanding the Pokémon Center:** Successfully recognized a building as a likely Pokémon Center based on visual cues and proximity.
* ** Importance of image recognition:** Having a visual reference of the in-game screen is important for navigation.

## IV. Obstacles Faced

*   **Low HP Management:** Maintaining Pidgey's health is a significant constraint, limiting exploration opportunities and forcing a detour to the Pokémon Center.
*   **Navigational Inaccuracy:** Initial uncertainty about our location after battles resulted in inefficient movement.
*   **Wild Encounters:** Random encounters, while unavoidable, further deplete Pidgey's health and extend the time required to reach the Pokémon Center.

## V. Next Objectives

1.  **Enter and Heal:** Move inside the Viridian City Pokémon Center and interact with the Nurse Joy to fully heal Pidgey.
2.  **Explore Viridian City:** Once Pidgey is healed, explore Viridian City and look for points of interest like the Poké Mart and any potential story progression cues.
3.  **Resume Original Goal:** After healing and orientation, resume the original goal of exploring the world, specifically looking for Pikachu.  Consider revisiting Viridian Forest.

## VI. Strategies & Lessons Learned

*   **Prioritize HP:** Always monitor the HP of the lead Pokémon and prioritize healing to minimize the risk of fainting.
*   **Efficient Pathing:** Once healed, plan routes to minimize encounters, especially with a lower-level party.
*   **Environmental Awareness:** Pay close attention to landmarks and environmental features to improve navigation skills.
