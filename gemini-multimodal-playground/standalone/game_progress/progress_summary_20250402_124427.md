# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

*   **Party:** Pidgey (Level 5)
*   **Health:** Not explicitly known but battle-worn (around 5/17 HP before the last battle).
*   **Location:** Implicitly still in an early route, actively seeking and engaging in battles.
*   **Progress:** Gained a level, now Level 5. Demonstrated basic battle competence.

## Recent Actions (Turns 85-94)

*   **Engaged in a prolonged battle with a wild Pidgey.** This highlights a focus on grinding and gaining experience.
*   **Primarily used the "Tackle" move.** This suggests a reliance on the Pidgey's default attack.
*   **Successfully defeated the wild Pidgey.** This marks a significant accomplishment and confirms the effectiveness of current strategies (albeit potentially inefficient ones).
*   **Leveled up Pidgey to Level 5.**  This reinforces the effort put into battles and the gradual improvement of the Pokémon.
*   **Experienced level-up sequence.** This is a standard part of the game loop, confirming progression.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Tackle is a viable, albeit potentially slow, attack method.** The prolonged battle suggests that Tackle might not be the most efficient move.
*   **Battles are a core mechanic for leveling up.** The repeated battle encounters demonstrate a focus on gaining experience points (EXP).
*   **Pidgey can successfully defeat other Pokémon.** This validates the initial choice of Pokémon and the feasibility of the current strategy.

## Next Objectives

*   **Continue battling wild Pokémon to further level up Pidgey.** Leveling up will make future battles easier and unlock new moves.
*   **Explore other battle strategies beyond simply using Tackle.** Experimenting with different tactics could lead to more efficient and effective combat.
*   **Potentially consider catching other Pokémon to diversify the party.** Having more than one Pokémon will provide more options in battle and allow for better type coverage.
*   **Heal Pidgey after battles.** Low health points will make future battles more challenging. Locating a Pokémon Center or using healing items should be prioritized.
