# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:** Actively training Pikachu to level up by battling wild Pokémon in the tall grass. Pikachu's HP is consistently around 16/19.

**Recent Actions (Turns 15-24):**

*   **Objective:** Level up Pikachu.
*   **Turn 15:** Recovered from being in the BAG menu and returned to the FIGHT menu. Used Thundershock on a Pidgey.
*   **Turns 16-20:** Repeatedly entered battles in the tall grass, defeated wild Pokémon (likely Pidgeys based on EXP gained), and exited battle. Gained 31 EXP points per battle. The primary actions were pressing A to advance text and pressing Up to enter tall grass.
*   **Turn 21:** Encountered a wild Pidgey, initiating a new battle.
*   **Turn 22:** Selected the FIGHT option in the battle menu.
*   **Turn 23:** Chose the Thundershock move.
*   **Turn 24:** Advanced the dialog after using Thundershock.

**Key Discoveries & Insights:**

*   **Efficient Training:** Repeated battles in the tall grass yield consistent EXP gains of 31 per battle. This is an effective, albeit repetitive, method for leveling up at this stage of the game.
*   **Pikachu's Moveset:** Pikachu currently has two moves: Growl and Thundershock. Thundershock is recognized as the superior attacking move.
*   **HP Management:** Pikachu's HP remains relatively consistent, indicating that Thundershock is often a one-hit KO or the battles are relatively short, so healing items aren't currently required.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Repetitive Gameplay:** The primary challenge is the repetitive nature of grinding levels by engaging in numerous consecutive battles.
*   **Menu Navigation:** Initially, there was a brief confusion about navigating back to the FIGHT menu from the BAG menu (Turn 15). This suggests a need for more careful menu selection in the future.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Continue Leveling:** Persist with battling in the tall grass to further increase Pikachu's level.
2.  **Monitor HP:** Continuously monitor Pikachu's HP during battles to determine if/when healing items become necessary.
3.  **Explore New Areas (Future):** Once Pikachu reaches a sufficient level, explore new areas to progress further in the game.
4.  **Learn New Moves (Future):** Consider strategies for learning new, more powerful moves for Pikachu.

**Overall Assessment:** Progress is being made towards the primary goal of leveling up Pikachu. The current strategy of repeated battles is effective, but future exploration and new move acquisition should be considered for continued progress.
