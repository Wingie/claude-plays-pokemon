# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Find battles to train Mankey.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, on a path surrounded by tall grass and trees. Consistent environment encountered over recent turns.
*   **Party:** Mankey (Level 5).
*   **Engagement:** Currently in a battle with a wild Rattata (Level 2).

## Recent Actions (Turns 35-44)

The primary activity over the last ten turns has been focused on exploration and battle-seeking. Initial turns (35-41) involved navigating a path with tall grass, attempting to trigger wild Pokémon encounters. There was an initial indication of looping behavior, which was addressed by changing direction (Turn 36). Finally, persistent movement through the tall grass (Turn 41) led to an encounter.

Turns 42-44 have been dedicated to the ongoing battle with a Rattata. The primary strategy is to use Mankey's basic attack, "Scratch," against the Rattata.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Environment:** The area is characterized by a path with tall grass and trees, suggesting a route suitable for early-game training.
*   **Enemy Type:** The presence of Rattata confirms a common early-game encounter, ideal for gaining experience.
*   **Level Discrepancy:** Mankey (Level 5) is currently higher level than the encountered Rattata (Level 2). This may indicate an area that is either too low level or a limited pool of Pokémon available.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Defeat the Rattata:** Execute the selected "Scratch" attack and win the current battle.
2.  **Assess Experience Gain:** After defeating the Rattata, evaluate the experience points gained to determine if this area provides sufficient training.
3.  **Continue Exploration:** If experience gain is slow, explore further along the path, potentially moving upwards as the path suggests. This could lead to new areas with stronger Pokémon.
4.  **Consider Route Optimization:** If similar low-level encounters persist, explore alternative routes or consider revisiting previous areas that might offer better experience.
5.  **Monitor Mankey's Moveset:** Be prepared to change the strategy if Mankey learns new, more effective moves.
