Result: Button sequence Right executed

Gemini: Okay, I'm in the overworld on a path, and my goal is to find and win Pokemon battles. I see trees to the north and tall grass to the east and west. The recent actions indicate that I've been pressing 'right' repeatedly, so I should try a different direction to avoid getting stuck in a loop. Since my goal is to find and win Pokemon battles, I should head into the tall grass. I'll try moving to the east, into the tall grass.
