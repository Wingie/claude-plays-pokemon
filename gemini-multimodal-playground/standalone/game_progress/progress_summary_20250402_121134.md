# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Report Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on recent game turns)

**Current Goal:** Train Mankey to a higher level.

## Current Status

The trainer is currently located in the overworld, surrounded by tall grass and trees, after being transported back to the last visited Pokémon Center. Mankey has recently fainted in battle and requires further training. The trainer is currently healthy and able to travel.

## Recent Actions (Turns 63-72)

*   **Repeated Battles with Pidgey (Turns 63-69):** Focused on battling wild Pidgey with Mankey. The strategy consistently involved selecting the first attack option, presumably Mankey's strongest.
*   **Mankey Fainted (Turns 70-71):** Mankey fainted in battle against a Pidgey. The trainer was automatically transported back to the Pokémon Center. Since Mankey was the only Pokémon, the trainer declined to switch to another Pokémon.
*   **Return to Overworld (Turn 72):** The trainer returned to the overworld after being revived at the Pokémon Center.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Pidgey Encounters:** The area is populated with wild Pidgey, offering opportunities for experience gain, but also risks of fainting.
*   **Mankey's Weakness:** Mankey is currently too weak to reliably defeat Pidgey.
*   **Pokémon Center Recovery:** Fainting leads to automatic recovery at the last visited Pokémon Center.
*   **Limited Pokémon:** The trainer currently only has one Pokémon: Mankey. This limits strategic options and increases the risk of "white out" (game over) if Mankey faints repeatedly.

## Obstacles Faced

*   **Mankey's Low Level:** Mankey's low level makes it difficult to defeat even common wild Pokémon like Pidgey without fainting.
*   **Reliance on Single Pokémon:** The lack of a diverse Pokémon team significantly increases the risk of setbacks.
*   **Monotonous Battles:** Repetitive battles with the same Pokémon (Pidgey) can be slow and tedious for experience gain.

## Strategies (Successes & Failures)

*   **Using the First Attack:** Consistently choosing the first attack option proved insufficient to reliably win battles against Pidgey at Mankey's current level. This suggests a need for a more strategic approach.
*   **Focusing on Battles:** The strategy of battling wild Pokémon to gain experience is valid, but requires adjustments for the current situation.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Prioritize Mankey's Survival:** Focus on avoiding fainting. This may involve fleeing from battles, using healing items (if available), or carefully choosing attacks.
2.  **Find Weaker Opponents (if Possible):** Explore different areas to find potentially weaker wild Pokémon that Mankey can defeat more easily.
3.  **Level Up Mankey Strategically:** If available, identify and use moves that are effective against Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgey to level up Mankey faster and with more success.
4.  **Consider Catching Additional Pokémon:** Expanding the team with another Pokémon could alleviate the pressure on Mankey and provide more strategic options.
5.  **Explore the Surrounding Area:** Investigate the area around the Pokémon Center for potential items or new routes.

## Notes

The progress is currently slow and somewhat stalled due to Mankey's low level and the lack of a backup Pokémon. Strategic adjustments are necessary to overcome these challenges and effectively train Mankey.
