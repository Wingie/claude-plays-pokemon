# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Report Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on provided turns)

## Current Status

*   **Location:** A town (likely Viridian City) between two buildings, with a path leading north.
*   **Objective:** Find the PokéMart with a blue roof in Viridian City.

## Recent Actions & Progress

The primary activity has been attempting to navigate north to locate the PokéMart. Repeatedly, the game character has been moved north, and accidentally, opened the options menu. 

*   **Movement:** Consistent attempts to move north from the starting location.
*   **Menu Mishaps:** Repeatedly, the OPTIONS menu has been accidentally opened, requiring corrective action (pressing the B button to exit).

## Key Discoveries & Observations

*   **Starting Location:** The initial location appears to be a town (assumed to be Viridian City) positioned between two buildings.
*   **Pathing:** A clear path heading north exists from the starting location.
*   **Menu Access:** There appears to be a sensitivity or accidental trigger causing frequent, unintended opening of the OPTIONS menu. This is a significant hindrance.

## Challenges Encountered

*   **Navigation:** While the path is clear, progress is slow, and the PokéMart has not yet been located.
*   **Menu Interference:** Accidental activation of the OPTIONS menu is significantly disrupting progress and requiring repeated corrective actions.
*   **Orientation:** Confusion has set in regarding the correct path.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Northward Exploration:** Persist in moving north along the identified path.
2.  **Minimize Menu Errors:** Identify the cause of the accidental OPTIONS menu activations and implement strategies to prevent them (e.g., more careful button presses, controller configuration adjustments if possible).
3.  **Confirm Viridian City:** If the PokéMart is not quickly found, confirm the current location to be Viridian City through visual landmarks or NPC interactions.
4. **Re-evaluate:** If no progress is made in the next turn, consider alternate routes or directions, or consult a game guide to understand the layout of the town.
