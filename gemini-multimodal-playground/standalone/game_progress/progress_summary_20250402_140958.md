# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian City (just outside the Pokémon Center)
*   **Lead Pokémon Health:** Low (but recently healed, `needs_healing` flag needs correction to `False`)
*   **Exploration:** Just beginning exploration towards Viridian Forest.
*   **Progress Towards Goal:** Minimal progress made.

## Recent Actions & Analysis (Turns 0-92)

Our initial turns were characterized by navigational challenges.  We started with an unknown location and screen type, initially intending to head towards Viridian Forest.  We accidentally opened the menu (Turn 1) and quickly corrected this with a 'B' button press (Turn 2). After getting outside the PC (Turn 5), several steps were taken to the right, presumably toward Viridian Forest.  However, somewhere along the way (before turn 88), our lead Pokémon's health dropped to a low 22/31, triggering the `needs_healing` flag. This necessitated a detour back to the Viridian City Pokémon Center.

Turns 88-92 were dedicated to healing at the Pokémon Center.  We engaged in dialogue with the nurse, pressing 'A' multiple times to advance through the conversation.  Exiting the Pokémon Center proved more difficult than anticipated, taking two attempts (Turns 90-91), and unfortunately the `needs_healing` flag hasn't been correctly updated to `False` even after healing. Now, just outside the Pokémon Center, we are re-orienting ourselves to head towards Viridian Forest.

**Challenges & Setbacks:**

*   **Location Uncertainty:**  Starting with an unknown location and lack of coordinate data makes initial navigation difficult.
*   **Accidental Menu Activation:**  Accidental button presses can disrupt planned actions, requiring corrective measures.
*   **Low HP & Healing Detour:**  Taking damage before reaching Viridian Forest forced a detour, delaying our primary objective.
*   **Inaccurate Status Flag:** The `needs_healing` flag remains erroneously set to `True` after healing at the Pokémon Center. This requires immediate correction.

**Strategies & Adjustments:**

*   **Iterative Navigation:** With no map data, a step-by-step approach is being used, observing the environment and adjusting course accordingly.
*   **Prioritization of Healing:** Recognizing the need for healing and making the decision to return to the Pokémon Center was a critical strategic choice.
*   **Flag Correction:** Immediately setting the `needs_healing` flag to `False` once out of the Pokecenter.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Viridian City Location:**  We've confirmed our location as Viridian City and are now near the route to Viridian Forest.
*   **Pokémon Center Functionality:** Demonstrated the process of healing Pokémon at a Pokémon Center.
*   **Need for Careful Navigation:** Demonstrated the importance of careful navigation to prevent unintended detours.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Correct `needs_healing` Flag:** Manually set the `needs_healing` flag to `False` immediately.
2.  **Navigate to Viridian Forest:** Resume the journey to Viridian Forest, prioritizing a direct route from the Pokémon Center exit.
3.  **Enter Viridian Forest:**  Once at the forest entrance, enter and begin exploring the tall grass.
4.  **Encounter and Catch Pikachu:**  Continue exploring the forest, engaging in battles, and attempting to catch a Pikachu using available Poké Balls.
5.  **Update Coordinate System:**  Attempt to establish a coordinate system, using fixed buildings in Viridian City to establish the location and movement.
