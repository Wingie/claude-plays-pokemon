# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Current Goal:** Explore the world and encounter a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently in tall grass (specific location unknown).
*   **Party:**
    *   Pidgey: Level Unknown, HP: 15/27. No additional Pokémon currently.
*   **Objective:** Still actively searching for a Pikachu.

## Recent Actions (Turns 37-46)

Our primary activity over the last ten turns has been battling wild Rattata in tall grass. These encounters have been consistent, providing Pidgey with small experience gains. The combat strategy has been straightforward, relying solely on Pidgey's "Tackle" move.

*   **Turn 37-39:** Repeatedly used Tackle against wild Rattata.
*   **Turn 40-41, 46:** Defeated Rattata, gained 24 EXP each time. Focused on exiting the battle screen after victory.
*   **Turn 42-45:** Navigated the tall grass, attempting to trigger new encounters. Mostly moved up. HP has remained above the healing threshold (30% of max HP).

## Key Discoveries

*   **Rattata Abundance:** Wild Rattata are prevalent in the current area. This is both beneficial for gaining experience and detrimental as we are diverting from finding a Pikachu.
*   **Healing Threshold:** Pidgey's HP is being closely monitored, and the 30% threshold (8.1 HP) for needing healing is being used to determine whether to head to a Pokémon Center.
*   **Simple Combat:** The battles have been simple, using only Tackle so far. This indicates we need to find new moves or Pokémon to develop a stronger strategy.
*   **Limited Information:** We don't currently have a sense of our specific location within the game world, and have no access to the overworld map.

## Challenges

*   **Pikachu Elusiveness:** We have yet to encounter a Pikachu.
*   **Repetitive Battles:** The constant Rattata battles are becoming monotonous and slow progress towards the primary goal.
*   **Limited Move Set:** Pidgey's reliance on a single move ("Tackle") limits combat effectiveness.
*   **HP Management:** while HP has remained above 30% of max HP, damage accumulation poses a risk.
*   **Navigational Uncertainty**: Our lack of location and map awareness makes it challenging to strategize movement.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Prioritize Pikachu Search:** While experience gain is useful, the primary focus should be on encountering a Pikachu. To improve chances of finding one, try moving to new patches of tall grass in different directions (left, right, down).
2.  **Identify Location:** Attempt to determine our current location within the game world. This might involve trying to reach a town or landmark.
3.  **Find New Moves:** Explore opportunities for Pidgey to learn new moves. This could involve leveling up or using TMs/HMs.
4.  **Consider Catching More Pokémon:** If encountering other Pokémon aside from Rattata, consider catching them to diversify the team and combat options.
5.  **Monitor HP:** Continue closely monitoring Pidgey's HP, but only seek healing when truly necessary to save time.
