# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Exploring Route 1 with the primary goal of finding and winning battles to gain experience and learn basic combat mechanics.
*   Pidgey is currently at 11/17 HP.
*   Currently engaged in a battle against a wild Rattata.

**Recent Actions (Turns 55-64):**

*   **Route 1 Exploration:** Focused on navigating Route 1, specifically areas with tall grass, to encounter wild Pokémon. Initially struggled with movement due to obstacles like ledges and fences, leading to inconsistent movement patterns.
*   **Battle Initiation:** Successfully triggered multiple battles with wild Pokémon.
*   **Combat Strategy:** Consistently using the first available attack (Tackle with Pidgey) during battles.
*   **Encountered a Rattata:** Successfully engaged in battle with a wild Rattata and using the Tackle ability.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   **Route 1 Environment:** Identified tall grass as a primary source of wild Pokémon encounters. Awareness of obstacles like ledges and fences impacting movement is growing.
*   **Combat Basics:** Initiated combat and using the default attack. HP monitoring has begun (Pidgey's current HP is being tracked).
*   **Enemy Type:** Encountered and battled a Rattata in Route 1.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Navigation Obstacles:** Ledges and fences on Route 1 initially hindered efficient movement and exploration.
*   **Repetitive Actions:** The strategy of always using the first attack might not be optimal in all situations.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Win Current Battle:** Defeat the current wild Rattata using the Tackle attack.
2.  **Continue Battle Training:** Seek out and engage in more battles on Route 1 to improve combat skills.
3.  **Evaluate Attack Strategy:** Begin to assess the effectiveness of simply using the first attack, and explore alternative combat options if they become available.
4.  **Improve Route 1 Navigation:** Continue to learn the layout of Route 1, identifying key landmarks and optimal paths through the tall grass, while circumventing obstacles.
5.  **Monitor Pidgey's Health:** Closely watch Pidgey's HP during battles and consider strategies to heal if necessary (though healing items are currently unavailable).
6.  **Explore Different Tiles:** Attempt to walk through a different set of tiles to attempt to trigger a battle with a different species of Pokemon.
