# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest, coordinates (11, 4).
*   **Screen:** Currently stuck on the Battle Summary screen.
*   **Status Effects:** No status effects. Our Pokémon do not currently need healing.
*   **Objective Progress:** Currently clearing a battle summary after defeating a Weedle.  We have not yet encountered a Pikachu.

## Recent Actions (Turns 15-24)

The last ten turns have been spent repeatedly clearing the Battle Summary screen following a battle with a Weedle. We are currently in a loop where we are continually pressing the 'A' button to exit this screen. It appears we are having difficulty returning to the overworld map after the battle.

**Turn Breakdown:**

*   Turns 15-24: Consistently analyzed the situation as being stuck on the Battle Summary screen and repeatedly planned to press the 'A' button.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Confirmation of Location:** The game confirms we are in Viridian Forest.
*   **Common Encounter:** Weedle is a common Pokémon in our current area within Viridian Forest.
*   **Persistent Issue:** We are experiencing a significant problem transitioning from the Battle Summary screen back to the overworld.  This is preventing further exploration.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Battle Summary Lock:** The primary challenge is being trapped within the Battle Summary screen. We are unable to progress past this screen despite repeated attempts to clear it. This is severely hindering our progress.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Escape Battle Summary Loop:** The absolute top priority is to resolve the issue of being stuck in the Battle Summary screen. We need to successfully transition back to the overworld to resume exploration. Possible solutions include:
    *   **Continuing to press 'A':** Perhaps we haven't pressed it enough times.
    *   **Trying alternative buttons:** Experiment with other buttons to see if they can break the cycle.
    *   **Analyzing potential game glitches:** Research if this is a known issue with the game or emulator, and if there are workarounds.

2.  **Resume Exploration:** Once the Battle Summary issue is resolved, we need to resume exploring Viridian Forest.

3.  **Find Pikachu:** Actively search for a Pikachu encounter within Viridian Forest. We can do this by continuing to move through the tall grass.

4.  **Catch Pikachu:** Upon encountering a Pikachu, attempt to catch it using Poké Balls.

## Strategic Considerations

*   **Troubleshooting:** We need to identify what input or sequence of inputs is necessary to exit the Battle Summary screen.
*   **Patience:** Catching a Pikachu might require multiple encounters and attempts. Remain patient and persistent.
