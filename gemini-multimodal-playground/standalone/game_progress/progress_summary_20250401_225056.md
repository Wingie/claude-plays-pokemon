# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen - Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Outside the Pokémon Center, ready to explore and catch Pokémon.
*   Current party: Charmander (fainted, requiring healing).
*   Have 10 Poké Balls and 1 Antidote.
*   Objective: Explore the area and catch Pokémon.

**Recent Actions:**

*   **Turn 20-22:** Stuck in a loop inside the Pokémon Center due to a potential error in game state recognition. Attempted to leave by moving left.
*   **Turn 23-24:** Successfully exited the Pokémon Center and moved towards the grassy area north-east of the Pokémon Center.
*   **Turn 25-27:** Entered the Poké Mart and successfully purchased 5 Poké Balls.
*   **Turn 28:** Entered the Poké Mart. Declined the offer to buy Potions.
*   **Turn 29:** Entered the Poké Mart and purchased one Antidote.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   **Environment:** Directly outside the Pokémon Center is a grassy area (likely containing wild Pokémon), a person, and the Poké Mart.
*   **Items:** Can purchase Poké Balls (and potentially other items) at the Poké Mart.
*   **Persistent Loop:** Experienced an initial problem where the game state wasn't correctly registering movement outside the Pokémon Center, resulting in a repetitive loop. This seems to be resolved now.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Initial Loop:** Getting "stuck" inside the Pokémon Center due to potential issues with game state updates. This was temporarily solved by moving right, getting out of the infinite loop.
*   **Fainted Pokémon:** Charmander is currently fainted, limiting exploration ability. However, the immediate goal is to catch a new Pokémon, which can then be used to revive and explore.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Catch a Pokémon:** Explore the grassy area north-east of the Pokémon Center and attempt to catch a wild Pokémon. This is the primary objective to enable further progress.
2.  **Heal Charmander:** Once a new Pokémon is caught, return to the Pokémon Center to heal Charmander and restore the full party.
3.  **Continue Exploration:** After healing, explore further into the world, following the main story and discovering new areas and Pokémon.
