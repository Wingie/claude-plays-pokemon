# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon (specifically Pikachu)

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, likely Route 1, standing in tall grass at approximate coordinates (7, 5).
*   **Party:** Pikachu (Level 5, 19/19 HP)
*   **State:** Ready to engage in battles for leveling. No need for immediate healing.
*   **`current_screen_type` Override:** Currently set to "Overworld" due to a previous persistent error.  `is_in_battle` is set to `False`.

## Recent Actions (Turns 15-24)

*   **Turn 15:** Encountered a Caterpie. Analysed battle situation. Planned to use Thundershock. (Presumed success from subsequent errors)
*   **Turns 16-22:** Encountered a persistent error where the game incorrectly registered the screen type as "Battle" while displaying overworld coordinates. A forced override was implemented to set `current_screen_type` to "Overworld" and `is_in_battle` to `False`. Attempts were made to move left in the grass to trigger a new encounter, but coordinate updates appeared to be failing.
*   **Turns 23-24:** Acknowledged the failure to update coordinates and reiterating the objective to level up.  Attempted to move right within the grass to trigger a battle.

## Key Discoveries & Challenges

*   **Battle Strategy:**  Learned that Thundershock is a super effective move against Bug-type Pokémon like Caterpie, making it the ideal move for early-game encounters.
*   **Persistent Error:** Encountered a significant obstacle in the form of a looping error where the `current_screen_type` was incorrectly registered, preventing progression. A forced override of the screen type and battle status has been implemented as a temporary workaround.
*   **Coordinate Update Failure:** Faced difficulty updating player coordinates after correcting the initial error, stalling progress and making it difficult to trigger encounters.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Troubleshoot Coordinate Updates:** Investigate the root cause of the coordinate update failure and find a reliable solution to accurately track player position.
2.  **Trigger Battle Encounter:** Prioritize triggering a new battle encounter by moving consistently within the tall grass.
3.  **Execute Battle Strategy:** Once in battle, utilize effective moves like Thundershock to defeat opponents and gain experience points.
4.  **Level Up Pikachu:** Focus on grinding battles to level up Pikachu, the current lead Pokémon.
5.  **Monitor Pokémon HP:** Keep a close watch on Pikachu's HP and heal at the nearest Pokémon Center when necessary.
6.  **Explore Route 1:** Once leveled up, consider exploring more of Route 1 to discover new Pokémon and items.

## Notes

The persistent error encountered highlights the importance of robust error handling and debugging within the gameplay system. The successful override demonstrates a temporary workaround, but a more permanent solution is needed to ensure smooth progression.  Address coordinate updates to resume normal progress.
