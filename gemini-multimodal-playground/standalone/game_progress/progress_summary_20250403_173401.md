# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Exploration

**Date:** Current Date

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest
*   **Activity:** Exploring the tall grass, battling wild Pokémon.
*   **Party Status:** No healing needed (currently).
*   **Progress Towards Goal:** Initial exploration underway. Encountered and defeated at least one Weedle.  Pikachu remains uncaught.

## Recent Actions (Turns 5-14)

*   **Turns 5-6:** Initialized exploration of Viridian Forest. Moved within the tall grass at coordinate (4,4) in an attempt to trigger encounters.
*   **Turns 7-12:** Engaged in multiple battles with Weedle.  Selected "Fight" and used "Tackle" (Turns 7-9) or "Scratch" (Turns 10-12) as the primary attack move.
*   **Turns 13-14:** Cleared the battle summary screen after defeating a Weedle, presumably using the 'A' button. Location updated to (11,4) after the battle.

## Key Discoveries and Insights

*   **Common Encounters:** Weedle are a frequent encounter in the early parts of Viridian Forest.
*   **Battle Mechanics:** Confirmed the basic "Fight" -> "Move Selection" -> "Execute" battle loop.
*   **Overworld Transition:** Identified the need to clear the Battle Summary screen before continuing overworld exploration using the 'A' button.
*   **Location Tracking:** The game provides feedback on the player's coordinates on the map (4,4), (11,4).

## Challenges Faced

*   **Lack of Pikachu Encounters:** The primary goal of finding a Pikachu has not yet been achieved, indicating it might be a rarer spawn.
*   **Repetitive Encounters:**  Encountering multiple Weedle in a row could be time-consuming if the goal is specifically to find a Pikachu.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Exploring Viridian Forest:** Move systematically through different areas of the forest to increase the chance of encountering a Pikachu.
2.  **Optimize Movement Strategy:** Implement a more efficient movement pattern (e.g., systematically exploring different zones) to maximize encounter rate and coverage of the area.
3.  **Consider Alternative Strategies:** If Pikachu remains elusive, explore alternative approaches, such as using Repels to encounter higher-level Pokémon (if that's a factor for Pikachu spawning) after leveling up more.
4. **Vary Moves Used**: To improve battle efficiency, vary the move selections during battle.
5.  **Monitor Party Health:**  Keep an eye on party HP and plan for a return to the Pokémon Center in Viridian City if necessary to avoid fainting.
