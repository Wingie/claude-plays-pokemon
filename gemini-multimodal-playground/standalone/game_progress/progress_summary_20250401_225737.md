# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on implied recent activity)

**Current Goal:** Explore the area and catch a Mankey, Pikachu, and Pidgey.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently engaged in a battle with a level 3 Mankey.
*   **Party:** Charmander (Level 9, HP fluctuating between full and damaged (16/27, 24/27).
*   **Items:** Poké Balls (quantity unknown)

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 25-34)

*   **Mankey Encounter:** Initiated battle with a Level 3 Mankey.
*   **Combat:**
    *   Charmander used Scratch repeatedly to weaken the Mankey.
    *   Multiple attempts to catch Mankey using Poké Balls.
*   **Menu Navigation Struggles:** Demonstrated difficulties navigating the BAG menu during battle to select and use Poké Balls. Repeatedly stating the need to open the Bag, select PokeBall and select use, indicating multiple unsuccessful attempts.

## III. Key Discoveries & Observations

*   **Mankey Location:** Confirmed the presence of Mankey in the current area.
*   **Charmander's Effectiveness:** Scratch is a viable, though possibly risky, move for weakening Pokémon before capture.
*   **Inventory Management:** Difficulty selecting and using items during battle is a significant bottleneck.
*   **HP Management:** Charmander took damage from Mankey, requiring awareness of HP levels.

## IV. Challenges & Obstacles

*   **Catching Mankey:** Several Poké Ball attempts have failed to capture the Mankey.
*   **Inventory Navigation:** Efficiently navigating the BAG menu in battle is proving difficult, leading to wasted turns.
*   **Risk of Fainting:** Charmander's HP has been reduced during the battle, indicating a risk of fainting if the battle continues too long without a successful catch.

## V. Next Objectives

1.  **Capture Mankey:** The immediate priority is to successfully catch the Mankey. Consider lowering its health further with Scratch while being mindful of Charmander's HP.
2.  **Optimize Battle Inventory Access:** Develop a faster, more reliable strategy for accessing Poké Balls during battle. This may involve pre-planning button sequences or seeking assistance with the controls.
3.  **Explore for Pikachu and Pidgey:** Once Mankey is caught (or abandoned for now), resume exploration to find Pikachu and Pidgey.
4.  **Consider Item Usage:** Explore the use of potions or berries for healing to keep charmander in fighting shape.
