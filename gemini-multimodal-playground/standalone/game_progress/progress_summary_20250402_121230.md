# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Train Mankey by engaging in battles.

## Current Status

*   Mankey is currently under-leveled and has fainted in battle. We are back at the last visited Pokémon Center.
*   Positioned in the overworld, near tall grass suitable for encountering wild Pokémon.

## Recent Actions (Turns 63-72)

*   **Repeated Battles:** Primarily engaged in battling wild Pidgey.
*   **Attack Selection:** Consistently chose the first attack option for Mankey (assumed to be its strongest).
*   **Failure:** Mankey fainted in battle against a Pidgey, leading to a return to the Pokémon Center.
*   **Recovery:** Declined to switch to another Pokémon due to only having Mankey.
*   **Re-Entry:** After recovering at the Pokémon Center, the player is now in the overworld, near tall grass, ready to resume training.
*   **Direction change:** Player is now moving up

## Key Discoveries

*   **Pidgey Abundance:** Pidgey seems to be a common wild Pokémon in the current area.
*   **Mankey's Weakness:** Mankey is currently struggling against even basic Pokémon like Pidgey. This suggests a need for more training or a change in tactics.
*   **The Pokemon Centre Heals all:** The Pokemon centre is an important asset.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Return to Tall Grass:** Move back into the tall grass to initiate more battles.
2.  **Continue Training Mankey:** Focus on battling wild Pokémon, prioritizing those that are manageable for Mankey.
3.  **Assess Mankey's Moves:** Evaluate whether the first attack option is truly optimal. Consider exploring different moves or strategies based on the opponent's type and Mankey's current moveset.
4.  **Consider Alternative Training Locations:** If Pidgey battles prove too difficult or provide insufficient experience, explore other areas with potentially weaker Pokémon.
5.  **Potential Catching of Another Pokemon:** Consider capturing a pokemon to better deal with pidgey and provide training opportunities.

## Challenges & Insights

*   **Difficulty Curve:** The initial training phase with Mankey is proving challenging. The lack of type advantage and potentially lower stats are making battles difficult.
*   **Repetitive Gameplay:** Repeatedly battling the same Pokémon (Pidgey) may lead to slow progress. It's crucial to find variety in battles or adjust training strategies.
*   **Strategic Improvement:** The simple "select the first attack" strategy is not sufficient. Analyzing move effectiveness and type matchups will be essential for future success.
