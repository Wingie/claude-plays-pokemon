# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 65-74

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

*   Currently engaged in repeated battles with wild RATTATA.
*   Pidgey's HP remains stable at 11/17 throughout this period, indicating a sustainable but perhaps inefficient battle strategy.

## Recent Actions

*   **Strategy:**  Repeatedly selected the first attack option (presumably Tackle) against wild Rattata in encounters.
*   **Turn Breakdown:** Each turn consisted of initiating a battle with a Rattata and then using the 'A' button, selecting the first attack.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Enemy Type:** Confirmed the presence of wild Rattata in the current area.
*   **Battle Consistency:** Encounters with Rattata are common and predictable.
*   **Limited Move Pool:** Pidgey only seems to be using Tackle during these encounters, suggesting a limited moveset at this stage.
*   **Rattata's Move:** Discovered Rattata uses Tail Whip.
## Challenges

*   **Lack of Progress:** While battles are occurring, there's no explicit mention of winning or losing.  Progress towards understanding how to win remains unclear. The constant encounters with the same Pokémon suggest a lack of exploration or strategic variation.
*   **Inefficient Strategy:** Sticking to the first attack might not be optimal. Understanding type advantages and other attack options is crucial.
*   **Potential Stagnation:** The current strategy appears to be leading to a repetitive cycle with no noticeable advancement. Pidgey is not fainting, but neither is it clearly winning.

## Next Objectives

*   **Win a Battle:** Explicitly focus on winning a battle against a Rattata. Consider the factors that contribute to winning (HP, attack power, type advantages).
*   **Explore Attack Options:** Investigate the different attack options available to Pidgey, beyond just the first one. Learn about their effects and when to use them.
*   **Consider Item Usage:** Explore the use of items in battle, such as potions, to heal Pidgey if it takes too much damage.
*   **Varied Encounters:** Seek out different Pokémon to battle to gain experience and diversify the understanding of combat. Moving to a different area of the map might be necessary.
*   **Analyze Battle Logs (if available):** Review any battle logs (if the system provides them) to understand the effectiveness of attacks and identify areas for improvement.
