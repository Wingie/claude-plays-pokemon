# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   In the overworld, ready to continue exploring.
*   Pidgey at Level 9 with full HP (likely replenished after the battle)

**Recent Actions (Turns 10-19):**

*   Entered tall grass seeking a Pikachu.
*   Engaged in a battle with a Level 3 Rattata.
*   Successfully defeated the Rattata using Pidgey's Gust attack.
*   Pidgey gained 24 experience points.
*   Returned to the overworld (tall grass) to resume exploration.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Pidgey knows the moves Tackle, Sand-Attack, and Gust.
*   Gust is effective against Normal-type Pokémon like Rattata.
*   Wild Rattata are present in the tall grass.
*   Battles yield experience points for the Pokémon.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   Encountered a Rattata instead of a Pikachu.
*   Initial lack of information about Pidgey's moves required reactive adjustments.

**Strategies Used:**

*   Initially, a random walking strategy was employed to trigger battles.
*   Prioritized using Gust against the Rattata due to type advantage.
*   Focus on exiting battle screens after victories to resume exploration.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  Continue exploring the tall grass.
2.  **Primary Goal:** Encounter and potentially capture a Pikachu.
3.  Move Down three times to re-enter the tall grass.
4.  Move Right three times to trigger another encounter.
