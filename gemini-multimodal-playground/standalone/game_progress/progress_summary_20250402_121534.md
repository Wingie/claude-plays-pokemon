# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on recent turns)

## Current Status

*   **Goal:** Level up Mankey through battles.
*   **Location:** Currently in tall grass, location otherwise unknown. Features include trees to the left/right (varied), a ledge to the left (in early turn), and a path going north (more recent turn).
*   **Party:** Includes Charmander and Mankey (implied, since the objective is to level up Mankey)

## Recent Actions (Turns 25-34)

*   **Focus on Grinding:** The primary action has been initiating and participating in battles within the tall grass.
*   **Battle Strategy:** Consistently selecting the first attack option in battles.
*   **Encountered Pokémon:** Primarily battling Pidgey.
*   **Menu Error:** Accidentally entered the Poke Balls menu during battle (Turn 30) and had to exit using the B button.
*   **Charmander EXP gain:** Charmander gained 11 EXP in an earlier battle (Turn 25)

## Key Discoveries

*   **Reliable Battle Spot:** Tall grass seems to be a consistent source of wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Common Enemy:** Pidgey is a frequent opponent in the current area.
*   **TAC Encounter:** Pidgey knows the move "TAC" (Tackle, assumed) and uses it in battle.
*   **Orientation:** A path to the north exists, which could lead to a new area. Ledges and trees are also near the current location.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Repetitive Battles:** The frequent encounters with Pidgey may slow down progress.
*   **Menu Navigation Errors:** Accidentally opening the Poke Balls menu during battle is a potential time-waster.
*   **Unknown Location:** Lack of specific location information makes targeted exploration difficult.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Grinding:** Persist in battling wild Pokémon in the tall grass to level up Mankey.
2.  **Optimize Battle Strategy:** Explore different attack options or party member switches (if possible) to speed up battles and maximize experience gain.
3.  **Map Awareness:** Pay closer attention to landmarks (trees, ledges, the northern path) to get a better sense of the surrounding area.
4.  **Exploration (Conditional):** Once Mankey has reached a suitable level, consider exploring the path to the north to discover new areas and potentially more diverse Pokémon.
5.  **Prevent Menu Errors:** Be more careful during battles to avoid accidentally opening the Poke Balls menu.
