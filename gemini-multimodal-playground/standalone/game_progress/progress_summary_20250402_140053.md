# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Exploration

**Current Status:** Exploring Viridian Forest. Lead Pokémon is at 26/29 HP. Currently in the Overworld, outside of tall grass.

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

**Recent Actions (Turns 10-19):**

*   **Battle Encounters (Turns 10-16):** The initial turns were primarily focused on battling within the tall grass of Viridian Forest. The bot initially became stuck in a loop, repeatedly selecting the first move ("Fight," then the first attack). This was corrected by manually specifying the third move, "Gust," to be used in subsequent battles. We successfully won a battle, presumably against a Metapod followed by another battle against a Pidgey.
*   **Clearing Battle Summaries (Turns 15-16):** After winning the battle, the bot correctly identified the need to clear the battle summary screen and executed the action of pressing 'A' to do so.
*   **Returning to Overworld and Pathfinding (Turns 17-19):** The bot transitioned back to the Overworld but found itself outside the tall grass. The bot has identified the need to move back into the tall grass to continue encountering Pokémon and has initiated movement to the left. It appears that the bot is currently stuck outside the tall grass.

**Key Discoveries/Insights:**

*   **Enemy Pokémon:** Encounters with Metapod and Pidgey have been confirmed in Viridian Forest.
*   **Move Selection Strategy:** The bot experienced an issue where it would only select the first move in battle. This was identified as a need to select "Gust" which is the third move in the list.
*   **Location Awareness:** The bot correctly identifies when it is in the Overworld, Battle, and Battle Summary screens.
*   **Pathfinding Challenge:** The bot needs to be in tall grass to encounter wild pokemon. The bot has recognized it is no longer in tall grass, but is having difficulty pathfinding to tall grass.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Initial Battle Loop:** The bot got stuck in a loop when selecting moves in battle.
*   **Pathfinding to Tall Grass:** The bot transitioned to the overworld outside the tall grass. Despite attempting to move left back to the grass, it appears to be stuck.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Correct Pathfinding Issue:** Resolve the bot's inability to move into the tall grass. Ensure the bot is able to navigate to areas where wild encounters are possible.
2.  **Continue Exploring Viridian Forest:** After the pathfinding issue is resolved, continue moving through the tall grass to trigger wild Pokémon encounters.
3.  **Pikachu Encounter:** Continue battling until a Pikachu is encountered.
4.  **Capture Pikachu:** Implement a strategy for capturing Pikachu once encountered (this will require Poke Balls). This may involve weakening Pikachu with appropriate moves and then using a Poke Ball.
