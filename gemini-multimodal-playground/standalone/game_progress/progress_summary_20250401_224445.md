# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

## Current Status

We are currently in Viridian City, still engaged in an extended tutorial dialogue sequence. We have witnessed a demonstration of Pokémon catching, specifically a Weedle. The tutorial is ongoing and preventing further exploration of the city.

## Recent Actions (Turns 8-23)

*   **Turns 8-23:** Primarily focused on advancing through tutorial dialogue by repeatedly pressing the 'A' button. This was necessary to progress through the initial introduction to Pokémon catching.
*   **Turn 20:** Confirmed the successful catching of a Weedle during the tutorial demonstration.
*   **Strategic Adjustment:** Identified a persistent pattern of being trapped in dialogue and implemented the repetitive pressing of 'A' to address it.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Tutorial Mechanics:** The game features an unskippable tutorial sequence that directly guides the player on how to catch Pokémon. This is essential for new players.
*   **Pokedex Functionality:** The Pokedex automatically updates upon a successful Pokémon capture, recording information about the species.
*   **Weedle Encounter:** Witnessed the capture of a Weedle, marking our first encounter (albeit indirect) with a wild Pokémon.

## Obstacles Faced

*   **Dialogue Lock:** The prolonged dialogue sequence restricted our movement and exploration. This "dialogue lock" presented a significant hurdle to achieving our initial goal of exploring Viridian City.
*   **Limited Player Agency:** The tutorial phase severely limits player choice and freedom, forcing us to follow a predetermined path.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Escape the Tutorial:** Continue pressing 'A' to complete the tutorial dialogue and regain control of our character.
2.  **Explore Viridian City:** Once the tutorial concludes, we will explore Viridian City, interacting with NPCs and discovering points of interest.
3.  **Attempt First Catch:** After the tutorial, we will obtain Pokeballs, and attempt to catch a Pokemon for ourselves.
4.  **Visit the Pokémon Center:** Locate and visit the Pokémon Center to learn about its function (healing) and potentially store a Pokémon if necessary.
