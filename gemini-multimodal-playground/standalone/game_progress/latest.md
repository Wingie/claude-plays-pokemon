# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Engaged in a battle with a Rattata.
*   Charmander is level 9 with 18/27 HP.
*   Struggling to navigate battle menus, often ending up on the Pokémon info screen unintentionally.
*   Still in the early stages of the game, with the immediate goal of reaching the Poké Mart with the blue roof in Viridian City.

**Recent Actions (Turns 90-99):**

*   Repeatedly accessed the Charmander's summary screen instead of choosing an action in battle.
*   Spent multiple turns attempting to cancel out of the summary/Pokémon selection screens to return to the main battle screen.
*   Finally recognized the need to select "FIGHT" to attack the Rattata.

**Key Discoveries/Challenges:**

*   **Menu Navigation Difficulty:** The game's menu system is proving challenging to navigate effectively, leading to wasted turns and potential vulnerability during battles.
*   **Rattata Encounter:** Encountered a Rattata, providing experience for Charmander but also highlighting the need to quickly learn the battle mechanics.
*   **Charmander's Level:** Charmander is currently at Level 9.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Prioritize Attack:** Immediately select "FIGHT" and choose an appropriate move to defeat the Rattata.
2.  **Improve Menu Navigation:** Focus on understanding the battle menu options to avoid accidentally accessing the Pokémon summary or selection screens. Experiment with different buttons to find the fastest way to select "FIGHT."
3.  **Continue to Viridian City:** After the battle, resume the journey north to Viridian City to find the Poké Mart with the blue roof and advance the storyline.
