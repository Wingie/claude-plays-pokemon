# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:** Engaged in a battle with a wild Pidgey in a forest area. Progress towards Viridian City is currently stalled.

**Recent Actions (Turns 63-74):**

*   **Navigation Attempts (Turns 63-71):** Initially, the player repeatedly attempted to move north through a forest, presumably towards Viridian City. These attempts appear to have been unsuccessful due to trees obstructing the path. A looping behavior suggests a failure to recognize the need to navigate around the obstacles. An adjusted strategy was attempted, but failed, and it was returned to the original looping method.
*   **Wild Pokémon Encounter (Turn 73):** A wild Pidgey was encountered, interrupting the northward journey.
*   **Battle Initiation (Turn 74):** The player engaged the Pidgey in battle.

**Key Discoveries & Insights:**

*   **Obstacles in the Forest:** The forest directly north presents a navigational challenge due to the presence of trees. A direct northward path is likely blocked, requiring a detour.
*   **Wild Pokémon Encounters:** The forest area contains wild Pokémon, as evidenced by the encounter with Pidgey. These encounters halt progress and require the player to engage in battle.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Navigational Difficulty:** Getting stuck repeatedly attempting to move directly north into trees demonstrates a challenge in navigating the forest environment.
*   **Pokémon Battles:** Wild Pokémon encounters interrupt the primary goal and require time and resources to resolve.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Resolve the Pidgey Encounter:** Continue the battle with the Pidgey. The outcome (capture or defeat) will determine the immediate next steps.
    *   **If captured:** Add Pidgey to the party (if space allows) or store it.
    *   **If defeated:** Proceed to step 2.
2.  **Navigate the Forest:** After resolving the Pidgey encounter, reassess the forest environment and attempt a different route to Viridian City, focusing on avoiding direct collisions with trees. Consider a strategy of exploring east or west before heading north.
3.  **Reach Viridian City:** The primary objective remains reaching Viridian City and locating the blue-roofed PokeMart.
