# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Location: Route 1
*   Objective: Train Mankey to gain levels through wild Pokémon battles.
*   Current Encounter: Engaged in a battle with a wild Rattata.

**Recent Actions (Turns 10-19):**

*   **Turn 10-11:** Exited the Pokémon Center (location (8,4)) and proceeded onto Route 1.
*   **Turn 11-13:** Navigated up the path on Route 1, searching for wild Pokémon.
*   **Turn 14:** Encountered a wild Rattata.
*   **Turn 15-19:** Initiated combat with the Rattata. Repeatedly using the "FIGHT" option (specifically, Mankey's "SCRATCH" attack). The battle is ongoing.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Route 1 is accessible and populated with wild Pokémon suitable for training Mankey.
*   Wild Rattata are present on Route 1 and provide an opportunity for experience gain.
*   Mankey's "SCRATCH" attack is being utilized as the primary offensive move.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   Currently engaged in a prolonged battle with Rattata. The outcome of the battle is uncertain.
*   No other Pokémon have been trained. Mankey is the sole focus of the current strategy.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Defeat the Rattata:** Secure victory in the current battle to gain experience points for Mankey.
2.  **Continue Training:** Remain on Route 1 to continue battling wild Pokémon and level up Mankey.
3.  **Explore Route 1:** Thoroughly explore Route 1 to discover other potential training opportunities.
4.  **Potentially Obtain Additional Pokémon:** Re-evaluate the team composition after Mankey reaches a sufficient level, considering the possibility of catching and training additional Pokémon to diversify the team's capabilities.

**Strategic Notes:**

*   The focus on a single Pokémon (Mankey) may be efficient for early-game leveling, but could lead to vulnerabilities later on.
*   Continuously monitoring Mankey's health during battles is crucial to prevent fainting and avoid costly trips back to the Pokémon Center.
*   The effectiveness of "SCRATCH" against Rattata should be evaluated as the battles continue. If it proves ineffective, alternative strategies or moves may be necessary.
