# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:** Exploring the early routes, focusing on battling wild Pokémon to gain experience and learn combat mechanics. Currently outside a Pokémon Center.

**Recent Actions (Turns 15-24):**

*   Repeatedly engaged wild **RATATA** in battle using **Charmander** and its **Scratch** attack (assumed to be the first attack option).
*   Consistently selected the first option during battle, which appears to be the primary attack.
*   Successfully defeated multiple RATATA.
*   Navigated the overworld, exploring a path, tall grass, and encountering a Pokémon Center.
*   Strategically entered tall grass to intentionally trigger wild Pokémon encounters.
* Pressed "A" multiple times to advance through post-battle dialogues and transition back to the overworld.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   The first option in battle is likely the attack command.
*   "Scratch" is an effective early-game attack for Charmander.
*   Wild RATATA are a common encounter in the early routes.
*   Defeating Pokémon requires pressing "A" to advance post-battle.
*   Tall grass is a reliable source of wild Pokémon encounters.
*   A "P.C." building likely stands for a "Pokémon Center".

**Challenges:**

*   Repetitive battles against the same Pokémon (RATATA).
*   Limited move pool for Charmander.
*   The need to blindly select the first option without confirmed attack names.
*   Navigating the overworld effectively to find diverse battle encounters.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Continue Battling:** Seek out more battles in the tall grass to level up Charmander and learn more about battle mechanics.
2.  **Explore the Pokémon Center:** Investigate the Pokémon Center to understand its purpose and potential benefits (healing, etc.).
3.  **Diversify Encounters:** Move to new areas to encounter different Pokémon and broaden combat experience.
4.  **Confirm Attack Names:** Identify and confirm the names and effects of Charmander's available attacks (beyond just assuming "Scratch").
5.   **Heal if Necessary:** If Charmander takes damage, seek healing at the Pokémon Center.
