# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Current Goal:** Find battles to level up Pikachu

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Stuck in battle loop
*   **Party:** Pikachu (HP: 14/20)
*   **Status Effects:** None
*   **Current Objective Status:** In Progress, but Blocked

## Recent Actions (Turns 85-94)

The last ten turns have been spent in a battle loop against a fainted Caterpie. The game is erroneously displaying the move selection screen even after the Caterpie has been defeated. Repeated attempts to advance the dialog by pressing "A" have been unsuccessful in breaking the loop.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Game Bug:** A significant bug has been identified where the game fails to properly exit a battle after defeating an opponent (Caterpie in this case). This results in a persistent loop where the move selection screen is displayed repeatedly.
*   **Pikachu's Condition:** Pikachu's HP remains at 14/20, indicating no further damage is being taken, but also highlighting the need for healing once the loop is resolved.

## Obstacles Faced

*   **Unbreakable Battle Loop:** The primary obstacle is the game bug, preventing any forward progress. It is impossible to exit the battle or heal Pikachu.

## Strategies and Insights

*   **Failed Strategy:** Repeatedly pressing "A" to advance the dialog and exit the battle has not worked. This suggests the bug is more severe than initially anticipated.
*   **Possible Solutions (Future Actions):** Since pressing A has failed, future turns should explore other input options. A reset of the emulator or game might be required if no in-game solution can be found. The following may be worth exploration:
    *   Trying different buttons to see if another button press triggers the end of battle sequence
    *   Trying to navigate the move selection menu in case the end battle dialog is tied to selecting a move
    *   Closing and restarting the emulator/game

## Next Objectives

1.  **Break the Battle Loop:** Prioritize finding a way to exit the glitched battle against the fainted Caterpie. This is the immediate blocker.
2.  **Heal Pikachu:** Once the battle loop is resolved, immediately heal Pikachu to restore its HP.
3.  **Resume Leveling:** Continue the original objective of finding battles to level up Pikachu. Re-evaluate location if necessary.
