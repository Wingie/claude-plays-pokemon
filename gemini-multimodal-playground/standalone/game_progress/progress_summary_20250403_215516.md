# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Route unknown, Overworld/Battle Transitions.
*   **Objective:** Level up Pikachu.
*   **Pikachu:** HP 17/20.  Learned Tail Whip. Moveset: Growl, Thundershock, Tail Whip.
*   **Engaged in Battle:** Repeatedly battling Rattata.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turn 30-31:** Exited Dialog and attempted to initiate battles by walking in tall grass
*   **Turn 32-36:** Initiated battle with Rattata and attempted to select "FIGHT" option.
*   **Turn 37-39:** Successfully navigated to move selection screen and selected Thundershock against Rattata.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Pikachu learned Tail Whip.** While not immediately useful offensively, this provides a new move option and indicates progress in Pikachu's development.
*   **Repeated Encounters:** The primary battle encountered is Rattata, likely due to the location.
*   **Move Selection:** We are now able to access the move selection menu and successfully choose Thundershock.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Repetitive Actions:** There appears to be a loop of initiating battles, attempting to select FIGHT (possibly already in the move selection screen), and advancing through dialog. The issue seems to be we are getting stuck in the move selection screen, potentially leading to repeated attempts to pick the FIGHT menu option
*   **Inefficient Leveling:** Battles against Rattata may not be the most efficient way to level up Pikachu. Exploring different routes or areas might yield encounters with stronger Pokémon or higher experience rewards.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Battling:** Keep battling to gain experience and level up Pikachu
2.  **Focus on Thundershock:** Use Thundershock as the primary offensive move to quickly defeat Rattata, if not already doing so
3.  **Explore New Routes:** Once Pikachu is at a reasonable level, explore adjacent routes to find new Pokémon and potentially better leveling opportunities.
4.  **Optimize Battle Strategy:** Evaluate if using moves like Tail Whip before Thundershock can make the battle more efficient.

## Long-Term Goals

*   Continue progressing through the main storyline.
*   Catch and train a diverse team of Pokémon.
*   Defeat the Elite Four and become the Pokémon Champion.
