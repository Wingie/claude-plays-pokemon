# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on implied "recent" turns)

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, Coordinates (7, 5). The coordinates have been variable, including (4,11) and (7,11).
*   **Party Status:** All Pokémon are fainted. Current HP is 20/26.
*   **Needs Healing:** Yes. HP is below 30%.
*   **In Battle:** No. `is_in_battle = false`.
*   **Stuck in a Loop:** Yes. The agent is repeatedly observing the same state and planning the same actions.

## Recent Actions (Turns 80-89)

The recent turns are characterized by a repetitive loop following a lost battle.

*   **Outcome:** The agent consistently encounters the "Huh? I ran out of POKéMON!" message, indicating all Pokémon in the party fainted during a battle.
*   **Repetitive Planning:**  Each turn involves the same plan:
    1.  Press 'A' to advance the text.
    2.  Return to the Pokémon Center for healing.
    3.  Move down out of the grass.
*   **Movement Failure:** Despite the intention to move down, the agent's location remains largely unchanged (primarily at coordinates 7, 5).

## Key Discoveries

*   **Confirmation of Battle End:** The text "Huh? I ran out of POKéMON!" reliably indicates the end of a battle where the player lost.
*   **Low HP Threshold:** The agent correctly identifies the need for healing when HP is below 30% of maximum.
*   **Loop Detection:** The agent recognizes it is stuck in a loop starting Turn 85.
*   **Navigation Difficulty:** The agent is unable to navigate out of the grass. It is repeatedly trying to move down, but appears to be stuck.

## Next Objectives

Given the current situation, the immediate priorities are:

1.  **Break the Loop:** Investigate why the agent is unable to move out of the grass and implement a solution to ensure downward movement occurs. The agent correctly identifies that it needs to move, but it is failing to do so.
2.  **Navigate to the Pokémon Center:** Once movement is possible, the primary goal is to reach the nearest Pokémon Center.
3.  **Heal the Pokémon:**  Heal the party to restore their HP and allow them to participate in battles again.
4.  **Re-evaluate Battle Strategy:** Analyze what led to the Pokémon fainting in the first place and adjust the approach to battles. Consider using items, switching Pokémon, or exploring easier areas.

## Insights and Analysis

*   **Navigation Problem:** The agent's primary problem is navigation. It understands that it needs to move, but it appears to be failing in its execution. This could be due to various factors, including:
    *   Incorrect mapping of game environment.
    *   Collision detection issues preventing movement.
    *   Incorrect input sequences for movement.
*   **Resource Depletion:** Running out of Pokémon suggests a lack of resources (e.g., Potions, Poké Balls) or a lack of strategy in battle.
*   **Opportunity for Improvement:** Despite the setback, the agent is correctly identifying the problem (low HP), the need for healing, and the desired location (Pokémon Center).  The next step is to address the navigation failure and implement a reliable pathfinding strategy.
