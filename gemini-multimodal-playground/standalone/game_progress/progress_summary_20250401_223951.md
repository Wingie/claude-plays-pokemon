# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 9-18

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Route 1 (North of Pallet Town, South of Viridian City)
*   **Primary Goal:** Reach Viridian City and catch a Pidgey.
*   **Party:** Charmander (level increased during turns).

## Recent Actions

*   **Movement:** Primarily moving North towards Viridian City by repeatedly pressing the "up" button.
*   **Battles:** Numerous encounters with Wild Pokémon, primarily Pidgey.
*   **Catch Attempts:** Several unsuccessful attempts to catch Pidgey. All encountered Pidgey have fainted during battle before being caught.
*   **Experience Gain:** Charmander has gained experience points from battles, resulting in at least one level up.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Pidgey Encounters:** Wild Pidgey are prevalent in the area between Pallet Town and Viridian City.
*   **Battle Outcomes:** The "attack" strategy employed against Pidgey has consistently resulted in the Pidgey fainting, preventing successful capture.
*   **Charmander's Growth:** Charmander has gained experience and leveled up, indicating progress in combat abilities.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Failed Catch Attempts:** Inability to successfully catch a Pidgey despite numerous encounters. The current strategy of attacking directly is proving counterproductive, resulting in the Pokémon fainting before capture.
*   **Repetitive Encounters:** Frequent wild Pokémon encounters are slowing down progress towards Viridian City.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Reach Viridian City:** Continue navigating north to reach Viridian City.
2.  **Re-evaluate Catch Strategy:** Implement a new strategy for catching Pidgey. Consider weakening Pidgey without causing them to faint before attempting to use a Poké Ball. Research alternative moves or items that could be useful for catching Pokémon.
3.  **Catch a Pidgey:** Secure a Pidgey for the party to increase team diversity and potentially exploit type advantages in future battles.
4.  **Explore Viridian City:** Once in Viridian City, explore the town, visit the Pokémon Center, and gather information.

## Insights

*   The game's encounter rate seems relatively high on Route 1, requiring constant vigilance and strategic decision-making.
*   The current strategy of attacking until the wild Pokémon faints is not effective for catching them. A more nuanced approach is needed.
*   Leveling up Charmander is beneficial, but capturing Pokémon is crucial for building a balanced and versatile team.
