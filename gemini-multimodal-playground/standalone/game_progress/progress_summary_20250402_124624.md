# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Gain battle experience, learn combat mechanics, and improve Pidgey's level.

## Current Status

*   **Pokémon Team:** Pidgey (Level 5, 7/19 HP after recent battles).
*   **Location:** Unknown, but actively engaging in wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Progress:** Successfully defeated at least one wild Rattata.

## Recent Actions

*   Engaged in multiple battles with wild Rattata.
*   Consistently selected the first option in combat (presumably an attack).
*   Successfully defeated at least one Rattata, earning 16 EXP for Pidgey.
*   Repeatedly chose the "FIGHT" option in the menu when presented.

## Key Discoveries

*   Wild Rattata are a common encounter in the current area.
*   Basic combat involves selecting attack options from the battle menu.
*   Defeating Pokémon yields experience points (EXP).
*   Pidgey has low starting HP (19) and is vulnerable.

## Challenges Faced

*   Pidgey is taking damage during battles, with its HP dropping to 7/19 in some encounters.
*   Battles can be repetitive (multiple consecutive encounters with Rattata).

## Next Objectives

*   Continue battling wild Pokémon to gain more EXP and level up Pidgey.
*   Vary battle strategies to learn more about different attacks and their effectiveness.
*   Monitor Pidgey's HP closely to avoid fainting. Consider finding healing resources (Potions or Pokémon Centers) soon.
*   Explore the surrounding area to discover new Pokémon and locations.
*   Learn about the Pokemon typings and use that to my advantage during battles.
