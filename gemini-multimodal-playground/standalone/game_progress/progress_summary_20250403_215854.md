# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Leveling

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon.

## Current Status

*   Currently located in Viridian Forest.
*   Engaged in a battle with a wild Caterpie.
*   Lead Pokémon: Pika, HP: 14/20.
*   Successfully used Thundershock against the Caterpie.
*   Waiting to advance the battle.

## Recent Actions

*   **Exploration:** Attempted to traverse Viridian Forest by moving right, repeatedly hitting the same spot at coordinates (8,5) .
*   **Encountered Wild Pokémon:** Initiated a battle with a wild Caterpie.
*   **Battle Actions:** Selected "FIGHT" in the battle menu.
*   **Move Selection:** Successfully used "THUNDERSHOCK" on the Caterpie.
*   **Advancing Battle:** Repeatedly pressed A to advance the battle after using Thundershock.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Viridian Forest Grind:** Confirmed Viridian Forest is suitable for encountering low-level wild Pokémon (Caterpie).
*   **Pika's Moves:** Pika's moveset includes Growl, Thundershock, and Tail Whip.
*   **Thundershock Effectiveness:** Thundershock is the most effective offensive move against Caterpie from the current moveset.
*   **HP Management:** Pika sustained some damage in the battle (currently at 14/20 HP).

## Next Objectives

1.  **Finish Current Battle:** Complete the battle with the Caterpie by advancing through the battle prompts until either Pika wins or loses.
2.  **Continue Leveling:** Resume exploring Viridian Forest to encounter more wild Pokémon. Focus on engaging in battles to gain experience points and level up.
3.  **Heal Pokémon:** If Pika's HP gets too low, consider using a Potion or returning to a Pokémon Center to heal.
4.  **Explore Different Areas:** If leveling feels slow, explore different areas within Viridian Forest or consider moving on to the next area after reaching a certain level milestone.
5.  **Optimize Movement:** Avoid hitting the same coordinate repeatedly and improve the traversal logic in the forest.

## Insights and Challenges

*   **Movement Stagnation:** The repeated movement to the same coordinates (8,5) indicates a potential flaw in the exploration logic. Need to implement better movement logic to efficiently traverse the forest.
*   **HP Management:** Battling wild Pokémon can cause damage. Conserving HP is crucial to avoid needing to backtrack to a Pokémon Center too frequently.
*   **Move Selection:** Understanding the effectiveness of different moves is critical for efficient battles. Thundershock is effective against Caterpie, but needs to evaluate move effectiveness against other Pokémon.
