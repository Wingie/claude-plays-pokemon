# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon.

## Current Status

*   **Location:**  Currently in an area with tall grass. Exact location is unknown but likely early-game, considering frequent Caterpie encounters.
*   **Team:**  At least one Pokémon: Pidgey, Level 12, 31/33 HP (observed in turn 47).
*   **In-Game Progress:** Basic exploration and battling. Focus is on leveling up.

## Recent Actions

*   **Exploration:** Moving through tall grass to trigger wild Pokémon encounters.  Initial movement patterns involved going right, up, then left. More recent movement is random.
*   **Battling:** Primarily encountering and battling Caterpie. One encounter with Pikachu (successful or not unknown).
*   **Move Selection:** Primarily defaulting to the first move ("A") in battle, until Turn 47, at which point the player explicitly selects "Tackle".
*   **Turn 47:** Encountered a Caterpie and selected "Tackle" after fight menu engagement. Player is finally engaging with the fight menu.

## Key Discoveries

*   **High Caterpie Encounter Rate:** The tall grass area has a high encounter rate of Caterpie.
*   **Pikachu Encounter:** A Pikachu was encountered, suggesting availability in the area. It is unknown if it was caught.
*   **Fight Menu Engagement:** Beginning to understand in-battle menu navigation and move selection (Turn 47).

## Challenges

*   **Lack of Information:** Initial turns were hampered by a lack of information regarding HP, movesets, and opponent types, leading to a default strategy of selecting the first move.
*   **Repetitive Encounters:** Frequent Caterpie encounters may hinder efficient leveling, as their low stats likely provide minimal experience.
*   **Objective Confusion:** There were conflicting objectives in recent turns, for example turn 1 & 2 state "objective is to find a Pikachu" but all the other turns state "primary objective is to level up".
*   **Random Movement:** Exploring with Random movement is not the most efficient way to find certain Pokémon.
## Next Objectives

1.  **Optimize Leveling Strategy:** Move away from defaulting to the first move.  Learn the moveset of the starting Pokémon (Pidgey in particular) and exploit weaknesses in Caterpie, increasing efficiency.
2.  **Continue Leveling:** Continue battling wild Pokémon to increase experience points and levels.
3.  **Pikachu Capture (If Not Already):** If the Pikachu encountered earlier was not captured, prioritize finding and catching it to diversify the team.
4. **Find a Healing Location:** Look for a Pokémon center or obtain healing items to address HP depletion from battles.
5. **Follow the Main Path:** Explore areas adjacent to the starting town to advance the plot.
