# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Level up Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   Engaged in wild battles, primarily encountering Caterpie.
*   Pikachu's HP is critically low (11/20), requiring healing.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 0-4:** Initial encounter with Wild Caterpie. Repeatedly pressed 'A' to advance dialogue and reach the battle menu.
*   **Turns 95-99:** Battle menu visible. Pikachu's health is low. Attempting to run from the battle by selecting the "RUN" option.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Consistent Encounters:** Wild Caterpie are a frequent encounter.
*   **Health Management:** Pikachu's low health necessitates strategic decision-making (running instead of fighting).
*   **Battle Menu Navigation:** Successfully identified the need to navigate the battle menu to select "RUN".

## Challenges Faced

*   **Low Pikachu HP:** Prevents engaging in prolonged battles for leveling.
*   **Initial Battle Dialogue:** Requires multiple inputs to advance before battle options become available.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Successfully Run:** Execute the "RUN" command to escape the current battle.
2.  **Heal Pikachu:** Prioritize healing Pikachu, either at a Pokémon Center or using items.
3.  **Re-engage Leveling:** Once healed, resume searching for battles to level up Pikachu, potentially targeting weaker Pokémon or areas with lower encounter rates until adequately leveled.

## Strategic Insights

*   **Prioritize Survival:** Running from battle is the correct decision given Pikachu's low health.
*   **Resource Management:** Be mindful of healing items and Pokémon Center locations to efficiently restore Pikachu's health.
*   **Targeted Training:** Consider seeking out specific areas or Pokémon that provide a better balance of experience and risk.
