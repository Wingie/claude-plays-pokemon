# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

Currently, we are located in the tall grass area and actively seeking Pokémon battles to gain experience and familiarize ourselves with combat mechanics. We have successfully initiated a battle with a wild Ratatta and are actively engaged in the encounter.

## Recent Actions (Turns 0-9)

*   **Turns 0-4:** Primarily focused on exploration within the tall grass, moving "upward" to trigger encounters. We encountered an obstacle, preventing further upward movement at position (10, 0). We adjusted our strategy and attempted to move "right" to circumvent the obstacle.
*   **Turns 5-9:** Engaged in a prolonged battle with a wild Ratatta. During these turns, we consistently selected the "first option" in the battle menu, assuming it corresponds to the most effective attack (likely Tackle or a similar physical move). Our priority has been on understanding the basic battle flow and attack mechanics.

## Key Discoveries & Observations

*   **Terrain Limitations:** Confirmed the presence of obstacles that restrict movement within the game world. We identified the edge of an area at position (10, 0) and adapted our movement strategy accordingly.
*   **Battle Initiation:** We've successfully triggered wild Pokémon encounters by traversing tall grass.
*   **Ratatta Encounter:** Repeatedly encountered a Ratatta, which is valuable for experience.
*   **Basic Battle Mechanics:** Attempting to learn the basics of combat by selecting the first available attack option.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Navigation:** Initial difficulty navigating the environment and identifying pathways due to obstacles.
*   **Lack of Specific Attack Information:** Currently selecting the first attack option without full knowledge of its effects or type. This could lead to suboptimal combat strategies.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Defeat the Ratatta:** Focus on winning the current Ratatta encounter using the "first option" attack method.
2.  **Explore Battle Menu Options:** After the current battle, spend time experimenting with other options in the battle menu (e.g., "Pokémon," "Bag," "Run") to understand their functions.
3.  **Develop Battle Strategy:** Once the battle options are understood, analyze our Pokémon's stats and available moves to create a more informed and strategic approach to combat. This includes identifying the move types (e.g., Normal, Fire, Water) and understanding type matchups.
4.  **Continue Exploration:** After gaining some combat experience, continue exploring the area, focusing on finding new Pokémon and potentially progressing to new locations.
5.  **Identify Our Pokemon:** We don't yet have an explicit mention of *which* Pokemon we are using. Figuring this out is essential.
