# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on the "recent" nature of turns)

## Current Status

*   **Objective:** Training Mankey through wild Pokémon battles.
*   **Location:** Overworld, assumed to be in an area with tall grass suitable for wild Pokémon encounters.

## Recent Actions (Turns 25-34)

*   **Initial Exploration:** Began searching for battles in tall grass (Turns 25-26).
*   **Navigation Issue:** Encountered a movement loop, repeatedly pressing "Up" and getting stuck in the same location (Turn 27). Corrected by attempting to move "Right".
*   **Battle Focus:** Successfully initiated multiple battles and consistently used the first attack option (Turns 28-34).

## Key Discoveries/Insights

*   **Tall Grass Mechanics:** Confirmed that tall grass leads to wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Movement Challenges:** Highlighted the potential for player error leading to inefficient exploration (movement loop).
*   **Combat Strategy:** Relied on a simple "first attack" strategy for battles. No further information about the nature of the battles or the effectiveness of attacks is available.

## Next Objectives

*   **Continue Training Mankey:** Persist in the search for and engagement of wild Pokémon battles.
*   **Optimize Movement:** Avoid getting stuck in movement loops and implement more efficient exploration patterns.
*   **Evaluate Combat Strategy:** Monitor the effectiveness of the "first attack" strategy and consider diversifying combat tactics as Mankey levels up and learns new moves.
*   **Map Awareness:** Pay closer attention to the surrounding environment to avoid repetitive exploration and identify potentially better training locations.
