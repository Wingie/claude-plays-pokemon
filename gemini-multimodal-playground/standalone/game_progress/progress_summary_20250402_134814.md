# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore the world and try to encounter a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Approaching the Viridian City Pokémon Center.
*   **Party Status:** Pidgey is at critically low health (15/27 HP) and needs immediate healing. `needs_healing = True`.
*   **Primary Objective:** Get to the Viridian City Pokémon Center and heal Pidgey.
*   **Secondary Objective:** Still have the original goal of finding a pikachu.

## Recent Actions (Turns 12-21)

Our primary focus in the past several turns has been managing a critical health situation with our Pidgey. We began engaged in a battle with a Rattata that left Pidgey with very low HP.  After defeating the Rattata and earning a small amount of EXP, we focused almost exclusively on navigating to the Pokémon Center in Viridian City to heal. Actions included:

*   **Turn 12-14:**  Completed a battle with a Rattata.  Determined `needs_healing = True` and set `designated_grass_location` to "Viridian Forest" and `designated_pokecenter_location` to "Viridian City PC". Exited the battle summary screen.
*   **Turns 15-17:**  Navigated out of tall grass. Initially moved in the wrong direction.
*   **Turns 18-21:**  Corrected course and began moving toward a building identified as a likely Pokémon Center.  Repeatedly confirmed `needs_healing = True` and planned to enter and heal.

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Viridian City Pokémon Center Location:**  Located a building in Viridian City strongly suspected to be the Pokémon Center.
*   **Importance of Healing:**  The low HP of our lead Pokémon is severely impacting our ability to explore and battle.
*   **Navigation Challenges:** Initial difficulty in navigating the overworld and identifying the correct direction to the Pokémon Center. This resulted in some wasted turns.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Heal Pidgey:** Enter the Pokémon Center in Viridian City and fully heal Pidgey.
2.  **Explore Viridian City:** Once Pidgey is healed, thoroughly explore Viridian City.
3.  **Progress towards Viridian Forest:**  With a healthy Pidgey, resume exploration and move towards Viridian Forest to search for a Pikachu.
