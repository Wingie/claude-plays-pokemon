# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Party: Lead Pokémon (Pidgey) with low HP (15/27).
*   Location: Inside Viridian City Pokémon Center (assumed).
*   Goal:  Heal party, then explore Viridian Forest to catch Pikachu.

**Recent Actions:**

*   **Initial Exploration (Turns 0-2):**  Began in an unknown location, aiming to find tall grass for Pokémon encounters. Moved upwards, presumably towards Viridian Forest.
*   **Accidental Building Entry (Turn 3):** Entered a building, location initially unknown. Assumed to be a Pokémon Center based on the presence of a nurse.  This was likely unintended.
*   **Continued Exploration (Turn 4):** Exited building, continued moving upwards towards tall grass.
*   **HP Critical (Turns 17-21):**  Realized Pidgey's HP was critically low.  Initiated a detour to the Viridian City Pokémon Center for healing.  Successfully navigated towards and entered the building.
*   **Menu Navigation (Turn 1):** Briefly accessed the menu and successfully exited.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Identified likely location as Viridian City and the Pokémon Center.
*   Recognized the importance of monitoring party HP.
*   Found a likely path to the tall grass in Viridian Forest.
*   Need to heal Pidgey.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Accidental Building Entry:** Unintentionally entered a building, disrupting the initial exploration plan.
*   **Low HP:**  Pidgey's low HP forced a detour, highlighting the need for careful management of Pokémon health.
*   **Initial Location Ambiguity:** Started in an unknown location, requiring exploration to orient.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Heal Party:** Complete the healing process at the Pokémon Center.
2.  **Navigate to Viridian Forest:**  Once healed, proceed north to Viridian Forest.
3.  **Pikachu Hunt:** Explore the tall grass in Viridian Forest and attempt to catch a Pikachu.

**Insights and Strategies:**

*   **Prioritize Healing:** The low HP situation emphasized the need to monitor and address the party's health.  Healing becomes the top priority.
*   **Strategic Movement:** Focus on clear, directional movements (up, down, left, right) to navigate the world effectively.
*   **Location Awareness:** Continuously attempt to identify and confirm the current location for better navigation.
