# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

We are currently exploring the starting area, engaging in battles to gain experience and learn combat mechanics. We have successfully won at least one battle. Our Pokémon is gaining experience.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 70-73:** Repeatedly engaged a wild Rattata in battle, eventually defeating it.
*   **Turn 74:** Pokémon gained 24 experience points from the battle.
*   **Turns 75-76:** Returned to the overworld (position 6, 11) and began navigating through tall grass to trigger further battles. We attempted to move right in the grass.
*   **Turns 77-79:** Initiated a battle with a wild Pidgey and repeatedly attacked.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Combat Basics:** We have successfully executed basic attacks in battle.
*   **Experience Gain:** Defeating Pokémon yields experience points, likely contributing to leveling up.
*   **Battle Trigger:** Walking through tall grass in the overworld triggers encounters with wild Pokémon.
*   **Enemy Variety:** We have encountered both Rattata and Pidgey, indicating a variety of Pokémon in the starting area.

## Challenges

*   **Repetitive Battles:** The initial battles have been against the same Pokémon species (Rattata, then Pidgey), potentially slowing progress.
*   **Location Stuck:** The current location of (6,11) seems to imply we are not moving efficiently enough

## Next Objectives

*   **Continue Battling:** Persist in encountering and defeating wild Pokémon to gain more experience.
*   **Explore Further:** Continue moving around in the overworld, potentially exploring different directions, to discover new areas and Pokémon. Consider moving away from the immediate (6,11) area.
*   **Observe Patterns:** Pay close attention to the experience gained from each battle and the types of Pokémon encountered in different locations to optimize training.
*   **Learn Battle Strategies:** As we encounter new Pokémon and gain experience, focus on understanding type matchups and learning effective attack strategies.
