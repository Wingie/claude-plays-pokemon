# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on assumed context)

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest, near tall grass (coordinates ~ (2, 11)).
*   **Objective:** Find and catch a Pikachu.
*   **Progress:** Exploring the tall grass to trigger wild Pokémon encounters. No Pikachu encountered yet.
*   **Party Condition:** Healthy, no immediate need for healing.

## Recent Actions (Turns 0-8)

The primary activity over the past several turns has been exploring Viridian Forest, specifically the tall grass areas. Actions have mainly consisted of:

*   **Random Movement:** Taking short bursts (3 steps) of random movement within the tall grass to trigger wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Battle Summary Handling:** Exiting battle summary screens after defeating wild Pokémon (likely Pidgey, given the level-up messages).

## Key Discoveries and Insights

*   **Location Confirmation:** Confirmed location as Viridian Forest.
*   **Encounter Rate:** Seems that several steps in the grass are required to reliably trigger an encounter.
*   **Pokémon Leveling:** While searching for Pikachu, Pidgey leveled up (at least to Level 10). This indicates steady progress in experience gains.
*   **Coordinate Persistence:** The coordinates seem to remain close to (2, 11) despite multiple movement commands, suggesting a small exploration area.

## Challenges

*   **Pikachu Elusiveness:** Pikachu has not yet been encountered, despite dedicated searching in Viridian Forest. This highlights Pikachu's relatively low encounter rate.
*   **Repetitive Gameplay:**  The repetitive nature of random movement followed by battle summary screens is a consistent characteristic of early-game Pokémon exploration.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Tall Grass Exploration:** Continue systematically exploring the tall grass areas within Viridian Forest, prioritizing areas not yet traversed.
2.  **Optimize Movement:** While random movement is a starting strategy, begin to consider slightly more directed movement patterns to ensure thorough coverage of the tall grass. Maybe move in a grid.
3.  **Encounter Pikachu:** Catch Pikachu when/if it is encountered.
4.  **Consider Route:** While searching, keep an eye out for a route exit to continue our journey after searching for Pikachu for a given time.
