# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Report Date:** October 26, 2023

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, Position (8, 11)
*   **Facing:** North
*   **Goal:** Find and catch a Pikachu.
*   **Current Action:**  Recovering from an unexpected battle encounter after navigating an initial area.

## Recent Actions (Turns 55-64)

*   **Turns 55-62:**  Attempted to navigate around a sign and trees at the starting position (8, 11). Initially, progress was blocked by seemingly impassable obstacles. Movement commands (up, right, down, left) had no effect initially. The area is described as having a sign to the west, trees to the east, and a path leading north. The player persisted in attempting to move north.
*   **Turn 63:** Encountered a dialog screen, requiring advancement by pressing 'A'. This suggests progress was made in moving north.
*   **Turn 64:**  Entered a battle. The player prioritized escaping to continue the search for a Pikachu, as their Pokémon are assumed to be weak.

## Key Discoveries & Challenges

*   **Stuck at Starting Location:** The player was initially stuck at position (8, 11) despite repeated attempts to move. It remains unclear what caused this.
*   **Obstacles:**  A sign and a line of trees appear to be obstacles that need to be circumvented. The method to bypass these was not explicitly stated, but moving north proved fruitful.
*   **Encountered Battle:**  An unexpected battle occurred, interrupting the search for Pikachu. This highlights the importance of being prepared for encounters, even when exploration is the primary objective.
*   **Battle Avoidance Strategy:**  The player opted to run from the battle, prioritizing the Pikachu hunt over battling with potentially weak Pokémon. This suggests a strategic approach of avoiding combat until the team is stronger.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Escape the Battle:** Successfully run from the current battle encounter.
2.  **Continue Exploring North:** Resume exploring the path leading north, as this was the only direction that yielded progress from the stuck location.
3.  **Locate and Catch Pikachu:**  Continue the primary goal of finding and catching a Pikachu.  This will likely involve battling wild Pokémon in the area and weakening a Pikachu for capture.
4.  **Evaluate Cause of Stalling:** If further stalling is encountered, attempt to diagnose why movement commands have no effect at certain locations. This might involve trying different combinations of directional inputs, or analyzing the surroundings more closely.
