# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore the world and encounter a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Lead Pokémon:** Pidgey, Level 8.
*   **Current HP:** Critically low (11/25 HP). `needs_healing = True`
*   **Location:** Unknown overworld location, potentially Route 1 or similar early route.  Recently exited tall grass.
*   **Objective:**  Immediately prioritize finding and reaching the nearest Pokémon Center for healing.

## Recent Actions & Summary

Our recent actions have primarily revolved around a low-level battle against a Rattata, followed by desperate attempts to navigate back to a Pokémon Center for healing.

*   **Turns 30-34: Battle with Rattata:** Engaged in a series of turns battling a level 3 Rattata. Pidgey sustained damage, leaving it with critically low HP.  Utilized "Tackle" repeatedly until Rattata fainted.
*   **Turns 35-39: Seeking Pokémon Center:** Upon exiting the battle, the priority shifted to finding the Pokémon Center.  The player is lost, with an unknown location name and coordinates.  Initial attempts to move "up" to leave the tall grass were successful, and the location is now outside of the grass.  However, now the player is going up and ignoring the pokémon center.

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Healing is Critical:** The Pidgey's low HP severely limits exploration and makes encountering wild Pokémon dangerous.  Healing is now the top priority.
*   **Navigation Challenges:** The player is currently disoriented and unsure of their location relative to the nearest town/Pokémon Center. This highlights a need for better map awareness or landmarks.
*   **Prioritized goal shift:** The need to heal has shifted the focus from finding a Pikachu to just finding a Pokemon Center.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Locate Pokémon Center:** The immediate and absolute priority is to identify and reach the nearest Pokémon Center. This may involve retracing steps, following paths, or looking for visual cues indicating the town.
2. **Explore the Area.** After healing the Pidgey, it is time to get back to exploring and trying to find a wild Pikachu.
