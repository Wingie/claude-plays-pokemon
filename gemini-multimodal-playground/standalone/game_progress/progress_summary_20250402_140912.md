# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian City, outside the Pokémon Center.
*   **Party Health:** Lead Pokémon (likely Bulbasaur or similar starter) is currently at low HP (22/31), *but* `needs_healing` is currently set to `False` after a visit to the Pokémon Center. This flag was initially not cleared properly after healing and required manual correction.

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 79-92)

The recent turns focused on a retreat from Viridian Forest to the Pokémon Center in Viridian City for healing, followed by a return journey towards the forest.

*   **Initial Problem:** We started near the southern edge of Viridian Forest with a critically injured lead Pokémon. Continued exploration was impossible without healing.
*   **Planned Retreat:** A multi-step movement plan was created to navigate south and east out of the forest and into Viridian City.
*   **Healing:** We successfully entered the Pokémon Center and progressed through the dialogue with the nurse by repeatedly pressing the "A" button.
*   **Exit and Return:** We exited the Pokémon Center, initially facing the wrong direction. We corrected our facing and are now positioned to re-enter Viridian Forest.
*   **Flag Management:** A bug was encountered where the `needs_healing` flag remained set to `True` after being healed at the Pokémon Center. A manual override was implemented to set it to `False`, preventing unnecessary returns to the Pokémon Center.

## III. Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Importance of Healing:** The initial state highlights the critical need to prioritize healing when low on HP, even if it means abandoning the current objective temporarily.
*   **Navigation Challenges:** Navigating the overworld requires careful planning, especially with limited HP. Pre-planned multi-step movements are necessary to get to our goals in the game.
*   **Bug in Needs Healing Flag:** We uncovered a potential bug where the `needs_healing` flag is not automatically cleared after healing at the Pokémon Center, necessitating manual intervention. This could lead to inefficient gameplay if not addressed.

## IV. Next Objectives

1.  **Re-enter Viridian Forest:** Our immediate priority is to re-enter Viridian Forest.
2.  **Resume Pikachu Search:** Once back in Viridian Forest, we will resume exploring the tall grass to encounter and attempt to catch a Pikachu.
3.  **Monitor Healing Status:** Closely monitor the lead Pokémon's HP and the `needs_healing` flag to ensure timely healing. If the flag bug persists, we will need to rely on visual HP checks and manual management.

## V. Potential Challenges

*   **Low HP Encounters:** Wild Pokémon encounters could quickly deplete our HP, forcing another retreat. We need to be prepared to use items or switch Pokémon if necessary.
*   **Pikachu Rarity:** Pikachu may be a rare encounter, requiring significant time and patience to find.
*   **Navigational Errors:** Incorrect movement could lead to getting lost or encountering stronger Pokémon than we're ready for.

## VI. Actionable Items

*   **Prioritize Healing:** Always keep an eye on HP and be ready to retreat or use healing items.
*   **Address Flag Bug:** Investigate the `needs_healing` flag issue and implement a permanent fix if possible.
*   **Map the Forest:** Consider creating a rough map of Viridian Forest to aid in navigation.
