# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, vicinity of tall grass near Viridian City (likely Route 1 or Route 2).
*   **Lead Pokémon HP:** 12/21 HP (Low, needs healing).
*   **Overall Status:** Initial goal of battling has been temporarily sidelined due to low HP. Prioritizing a trip to the Pokémon Center.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 90-92:** Battled and defeated a wild Pidgey, gaining 15 EXP. Initial assessment of HP was inaccurate; falsely believing healing was not necessary.
*   **Turns 93-98:** Realized the lead Pokémon's HP is critically low (below 30%). Attempts were made to leave the tall grass. Frustration is building as the exit from the grass is not immediately found. Decision made to move down to exit the grass. The location of the Pokémon Center is unknown; it is assumed to be to the left.
*   **Turn 99:** Accidentally re-entered a battle with a wild Pidgey while trying to escape the tall grass. Prepared to fight using the first available move.

## Key Discoveries

*   **HP Management is Critical:** The importance of monitoring and responding to low Pokémon HP has become apparent. Initial incorrect assessment caused several turns of wasted effort.
*   **Pokémon Center Location:** The exact location of the nearest Pokémon Center is unknown to the player.
*   **Tall Grass Traversal:** It's difficult to navigate the tall grass, resulting in unwanted encounters.
*   **Combat Engagement:** Initiated an accidental battle with a wild Pidgey.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Win the Current Battle:** Defeat the wild Pidgey in the current encounter.
2.  **Prioritize Healing:** After the battle, immediately locate and visit the Pokémon Center in Viridian City to heal the lead Pokémon. Consider using a Potion if one is available in the inventory to minimize further battles.
3.  **Proper HP Assessment:** More accurately assess and prioritize HP levels in future encounters to avoid unnecessary risk. Set `needs_healing = True` to keep track of the need for a visit to the pokemon center.
4.  **Navigation:** Learn better navigation strategies to efficiently move through the overworld, especially the tall grass areas.

## Insights

*   The player is learning the hard way about the importance of resource management (specifically, HP).
*   The early game involves significant reliance on information from the game interface, which highlights the importance of interpreting the information and making informed decisions.
*   Accidental encounters in tall grass can disrupt plans and necessitate adjustments to immediate objectives.
*   Frustration is increasing, as evidenced by the incorrect HP assessment and confusion about the pokemon center.
