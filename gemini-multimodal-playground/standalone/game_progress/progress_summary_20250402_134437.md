# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore the world and encounter a Pikachu.

## Current Status

Our current Pokémon, Pidgey, is at approximately 15/27 HP (fluctuating slightly). We are repeatedly encountering wild Rattata while exploring tall grass. The search for Pikachu continues.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turn 30:** Defeated a Caterpie in battle.
*   **Turns 31-39:** Engaged in repeated battles with wild Rattata. Our primary strategy has been to select "Fight" and use Pidgey's first move, assumed to be "Tackle." These battles have resulted in consistent, albeit minor, HP depletion for Pidgey.

## Key Discoveries

*   **High Rattata Encounter Rate:** The area being explored has a very high encounter rate with Rattata. This is hindering progress toward the primary goal of finding a Pikachu.
*   **"Tackle" is Pidgey's Primary Offense:** We have consistently relied on Pidgey's first move, assumed to be "Tackle," in combat. Its effectiveness seems reasonable, but battles drag on.
*   **Pidgey's Durability:** Pidgey's HP is slowly being worn down by constant Rattata encounters. Future strategy should account for this HP drain.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Rattata Overload:** The sheer number of Rattata encounters is significantly slowing progress and potentially draining Pidgey's health unnecessarily.
*   **Limited Move Set:** Only having one move (assumed to be Tackle) makes the battles repetitive and somewhat inefficient.
*   **Pikachu Elusive:** Pikachu has not been encountered at all.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Health Management:** We need to actively monitor Pidgey's HP. If it drops too low, we should consider finding a Pokémon Center or using a healing item (if available) to restore its health.
2.  **Continued Exploration:** Despite the constant Rattata encounters, we must continue exploring the area, hoping to trigger an encounter with a Pikachu. Possible strategy change: move to different areas to avoid so many Rattata.
3.  **Consider Leveling:** If Pidgey gets closer to leveling up, it might be worth grinding on Rattata to gain a new move or stat boost.
4.  **Item Investigation:** Identify available healing items and their usage requirements.
