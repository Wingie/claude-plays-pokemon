# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore the world and try to encounter a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently in a battle with a Rattata.
*   **Party Health:** All Pokémon at full health after visiting the Pokémon Center.
*   **Needs Healing:** False (No Pokémon currently need healing).
*   **Progress Summary:** We are actively searching for Pikachu and engaging in battles to level up our team. We are back in the tall grass of Route 2 or Route 1 (location unsure).

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 75-84)

*   **Healing Pidgey (Turns 75-78):** After encountering low HP on our Pidgey in Route 2, we successfully navigated to and healed at the Viridian City Pokémon Center. This involved identifying the building, moving to it, entering, and interacting with the nurse.
*   **Returning to Tall Grass (Turns 79-83):** Exited the Pokémon Center in Viridian City and began the journey back to the tall grass to resume the search for Pikachu and general leveling. There was a minor directional disorientation requiring multiple steps to head North.
*   **Encountered a Wild Rattata (Turn 84):** While moving in what was believed to be tall grass, we entered a battle with a wild Rattata. The current plan is to simply use the first available move.

## III. Key Discoveries and Challenges

*   **Viridian City Pokémon Center:** Successfully located and utilized the Pokémon Center in Viridian City, demonstrating an understanding of the game's basic healing mechanics.
*   **Route Navigation:** Experiencing some navigation challenges, particularly in moving between Viridian City and the tall grass areas. Suggests a need to pay closer attention to map details and compass directions if available.
*   **Pikachu Elusive:** Despite the primary goal, Pikachu has not yet been encountered. This may necessitate exploring different areas or using different strategies to increase encounter rates.
*   **Random Battle Encounters:** Confirmed that the planned routes to locate tall grass will result in random battle encounters with other Pokemon.
*   **Route Confusion** There appears to be some confusion regarding the location of Route 2 versus Route 1. It is possible we are on Route 1 at this moment.

## IV. Next Objectives

1.  **Defeat Rattata:** Win the current battle against the wild Rattata.
2.  **Identify Current Route:** Determine if our current location is Route 1 or Route 2 to better understand which Pokémon are available for capture.
3.  **Continue Searching for Pikachu:** After resolving the current battle, resume exploration of the tall grass in Route 2/Route 1 with the primary objective of encountering and capturing a Pikachu.
4.  **Level Up:** Engage in further battles to level up existing Pokémon, even if a Pikachu is not immediately found.
5.  **Document Move Sets:** Begin documenting the moves available to our current Pokemon.
