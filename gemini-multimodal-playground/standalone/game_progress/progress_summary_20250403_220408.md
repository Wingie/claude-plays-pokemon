# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon (Pikachu)

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Likely still within an early route (encountering Weedles).
*   **Pokémon Health:** Pikachu is damaged (11/20 HP), requiring healing. `needs_healing = true`
*   **In Battle:** Frequently engaged in battles, likely grinding for experience.

## Recent Actions (Turns 44-64 Summary)

*   **Engaged in multiple battles, primarily against Weedle.**
*   **Attempted to level up Pikachu by using moves like Thundershock and Growl.** Thundershock was determined to be the most appropriate offensive move.
*   **Battles frequently interrupted by low health (Pikachu's HP dipping below 30%).**
*   **Repeatedly attempted to run from battles due to low HP.** This suggests the leveling strategy is unsustainable in its current form.

## Key Discoveries & Observations

*   **Pikachu's Thundershock is being used offensively.** This implies the player is attempting to leverage type advantages where applicable.
*   **Pikachu is taking significant damage in battles, hindering leveling progress.**
*   **The player is aware of Pikachu's low HP and its implications.** They recognize the need for healing and are attempting to retreat.
*   **"Run" command repeatedly used**: suggests that the strategy failed or was ineffective

## Next Objectives

1.  **Prioritize Healing:** Immediately heal Pikachu to full HP. This likely involves:
    *   Returning to a Pokémon Center.
    *   Using Potions (if available).
2.  **Re-evaluate Leveling Strategy:** The current strategy of grinding against Weedles is proving unsustainable due to health constraints. Consider:
    *   Exploring alternative training locations with weaker Pokémon or different type matchups.
    *   Using held items to boost exp gain
3.  **Acquire Healing Items:** Stock up on Potions or other healing items to sustain longer training sessions.
4.  **Consider Catching Additional Pokémon:** Adding another Pokémon to the team could provide more options and alleviate the pressure on Pikachu.
