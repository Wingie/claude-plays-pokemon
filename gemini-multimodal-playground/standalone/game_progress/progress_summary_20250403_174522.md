# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Route 2, at coordinates (7, 5).
*   **Party:** We have one Pokémon in the party, with full health (24/24 HP). No healing is currently required.
*   **Battle Status:** Currently engaged in a battle.
*   **Opponent:** The current opponent is a Rattata.
*   **Poké Balls:** Quantity Unknown.
*   **Menu Problems**: Frequently getting "stuck" in the main menu and mistaking game states.

## Recent Actions (Last 10 Turns)

*   **Turns 5-8:** Struggled to exit the main menu. Actions taken were repeatedly attempting to exit the menu using the 'B' button.
*   **Turns 9-14:** Transitioned into battles, repeatedly. Plans involve selecting "Fight" and using the first available move. All were in the same location (7, 5) and the same Route 2.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Stuck in Menu:** We are having issues navigating the menu system. Need a more reliable method of exiting the menu.
*   **Route 2 Encounters:** Frequent encounters with Rattata on Route 2.
*   **Location Persistence:** Despite menu access, location coordinates remain consistent at (7, 5).

## Challenges Faced

*   **Menu Navigation Issues:** The most significant challenge is getting stuck in the menu and misinterpreting the current game state (menu vs. overworld vs. battle).
*   **Lack of Progress:** Repeated battles with Rattata in the same location indicate a lack of progress toward the main goal.
*   **Resource Depletion Risk:** While Poké Ball count is unknown, engaging in multiple battles without progressing could deplete resources if Poké Balls are used.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Menu Navigation Solution:** Implement a more reliable method for exiting the menu, potentially using specific button combinations or UI elements. This is the critical bottleneck preventing forward progress.
2.  **Advance Towards Viridian Forest:** After resolving the menu navigation issue, immediately move the character upwards towards Viridian Forest. Route 2 is a stepping stone.
3.  **Prepare for Pikachu Encounter:** Once in Viridian Forest, gather information on Pikachu's encounter rate and optimal capture strategy (e.g., weakening it to a certain health threshold). This requires acquiring Poké Balls, of which the current count is unknown.
4.  **Resource Assessment:** Check current inventory for Poké Balls and potions before entering Viridian Forest. If necessary, detour to the Viridian City Poké Mart.
