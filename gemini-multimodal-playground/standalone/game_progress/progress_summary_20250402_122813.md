# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

*   We have engaged in multiple battles with wild Ratata.
*   Our Pokémon party currently consists of Pidgey (initially low health) and Charmander (full health).
*   We have successfully won one battle (against Ratata with Charmander).

## Recent Actions (Turns 10-19)

*   **Turns 10-12:** Initially focused on attacking with Pidgey, repeatedly selecting the first option (assumed to be an attack move). This revealed a potential "stuck loop" issue due to repeated button presses.
*   **Turns 13-14:** Recognizing Pidgey's low health (5/15 HP), attempted to escape battle. The escape strategy involves pressing DOWN and A on the "RUN" option.
*   **Turns 15-18:** Switched to using Charmander for battles. Repeatedly selected the first option, which seems to be the "Scratch" attack. Charmander's full health allowed for sustained attacks.
*   **Turn 19:** Successfully defeated a Ratata with Charmander and advanced past the post-battle screen by pressing 'A'.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Combat Mechanics:** The first option in battle is likely the attack move.
*   **Escape Mechanism:** To escape a battle, pressing DOWN + A on the "RUN" option is required.
*   **Health Management:** Prioritizing escape when Pokémon have low health is crucial.
*   **Strategic Advantage:** Having a Pokémon with full health (like Charmander) allows for more sustained and successful attacks.
*   **Post-Battle Interaction:** Pressing 'A' is necessary to advance after a battle.

## Challenges Faced

*   **"Stuck Loop":** Repeatedly pressing 'A' can lead to being stuck in a loop during battles.
*   **Low Health:** Pidgey's low health necessitated an escape strategy.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Explore New Areas:** Venture beyond the current location to encounter different Pokémon and battle environments.
2.  **Improve Escape Strategy:** Perfect the DOWN + A command for escaping battles when necessary.
3.  **Optimize Pokémon Selection:** Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of Pidgey and Charmander to choose the best Pokémon for each battle situation.
4.  **Learn New Attacks:** Explore different attack options beyond the first available move to diversify combat strategies.
5.  **Heal Pidgey:** Seek out a Pokémon Center or use items to heal Pidgey and restore it to full health.
