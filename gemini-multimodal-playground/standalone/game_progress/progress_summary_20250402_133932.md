# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Located in Viridian City, outside the Pokémon Center.
*   Lead Pokémon (Pidgey, Lv8) is fully healed.
*   Objective remains: Explore the world and encounter a Pikachu.

**Recent Actions (Turns 70-79):**

The recent turns were dominated by a harrowing experience on Route 2! An encounter with a wild Pidgey left our lead Pokémon, Pidgey, with a dangerously low HP (5/25). Our initial strategy was to quickly defeat the Pidgey using Tackle. However, the battle proved more challenging than anticipated. As Pidgey's HP dwindled to a critical 2/25, we made the difficult decision to prioritize healing over battling.

We attempted to flee the battle, successfully escaping back to the overworld. Navigating back to Viridian City with such low HP was a tense experience. We carefully avoided tall grass to prevent further encounters, and managed to reach the Pokémon Center just in time. Pidgey was fully healed, and we're now ready to resume our adventure!

**Key Discoveries and Insights:**

*   **The Perils of Route 2:** Encounters on Route 2 can be dangerous, especially with a low-level Pokémon. Careful management of HP is crucial.
*   **Healing Prioritization:** When HP is critically low, fleeing is the best option to avoid a total party wipe. A full party wipe will put us back to the last pokemon center.
*   **Viridian City Navigation:** We successfully navigated back to Viridian City from Route 2 under pressure, demonstrating familiarity with the local area.
*   **Pokemon Center Process:** Confirmed that we can heal pokemon at the nurse in the pokemon center, restoring all Pokemon's HP.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Return to Route 2:** Head back north from Viridian City to Route 2.
2.  **Pikachu Search:** Resume searching for Pikachu in the tall grass of Route 2.
3.  **Strategic Battling:** Be more cautious in battles, prioritizing healing items if HP drops too low.
