# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Expedition

**Date:** 2023-10-27 (Replace with actual date)

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest (assumed). The player is currently in tall grass and encountering wild Pokémon.
*   **Objective:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.
*   **Party Health:** Assuming healthy enough to continue battling. No healing has been required so far (assumed HP > 30%).
*   **Battle Status:** Currently engaged in a battle.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 0-2:** Random movement within the tall grass of Viridian Forest to trigger encounters. The movement pattern was right, up, then left.
*   **Turns 3-9:** Repeatedly encountered and battled a Weedle. The 'A' button was pressed to attack in each of these turns.

## Key Discoveries

*   Viridian Forest (assumed) contains tall grass areas suitable for wild Pokémon encounters.
*   Weedle appears to be a common encounter in the current area of Viridian Forest.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Lack of Pokémon Information:** The agent lacks information about its own Pokémon's movesets and stats, preventing optimized move selection during battles.
*   **Pikachu Elusive:** Pikachu has not yet been encountered.
*   **Repetitive Encounters:**  Repeatedly battling Weedle without progressing towards the main objective (catching Pikachu) is inefficient.

## Strategies Employed

*   **Random Movement:** Used to trigger wild Pokémon encounters while exploring.
*   **Basic Attack:** Repeatedly used the 'A' button to attack during battles due to lack of information on move types and effectiveness.

## Strategies That Failed (or Need Improvement)

*   **Random Movement:** While triggering encounters, it doesn't guide us towards Pikachu. Consider more structured exploration strategies, if possible.
*   **Blind Attack:** Repeatedly attacking with the default ('A') attack is not optimal.  The game needs to provide feedback to allow for better decision-making.
*   **Lack of Healing Automation:** The reports consistently assumed HP > 30%. There is no proactive healing if needed.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Exploring Viridian Forest:** Persist in the search for Pikachu.
2.  **Improve Battle Strategy:** If possible, implement a system to track damage dealt by the current Pokemon's default attack ('A') in order to make better informed decision.
3.  **Implement Flee Functionality:** If encountering too many Weedles or if party HP gets low, consider adding a 'Run' option to battles.
4.  **Implement Healing Logic:** Proactively check for `needs_healing` and use items appropriately when needed.
