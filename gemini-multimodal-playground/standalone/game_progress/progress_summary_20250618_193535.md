# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Find battles to level up Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently stuck in a battle loop.
*   **Party:**
    *   Pikachu: HP 14/20. Needs Healing.
*   **Status Effects:** None

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 45-54)

The last ten turns have been characterized by a persistent bug. Each turn, we find ourselves stuck in a battle with a fainted CATERPIE. The game fails to advance past the move selection screen after the opponent is defeated. We are repeatedly attempting to press the 'A' button to advance the dialog and exit the battle.

**Repeated Actions:**

*   Observed the battle screen with the fainted CATERPIE.
*   Analyzed the situation and determined the game is stuck in a loop.
*   Planned to press 'A' to advance the dialog.
*   (Presumably) Acted by pressing 'A'.

**Outcome:** No progress has been made due to the game freezing.  We remain in the same battle state.

## III. Key Discoveries & Challenges

*   **Severe Bug:** A game-breaking bug has been encountered that prevents progression after defeating a wild CATERPIE. The game gets stuck at the move selection screen.
*   **Healing Needed:** Pikachu's HP is low (14/20), making it vulnerable to further damage if we ever exit the battle. We need to heal immediately after resolving the current issue.
*   **No Progress on Leveling:** The bug prevents us from battling other Pokemon and therefore stops us from leveling up Pikachu, which is the primary goal.

## IV. Next Objectives

1.  **Escape the Battle Loop:** The immediate priority is to find a way to break free from this battle loop. This may require:
    *   Attempting different button combinations (beyond just 'A').
    *   Restarting the game (if possible, and only as a last resort).
    *   Exploring any potential emulator controls or debugging options, if applicable.
2.  **Heal Pikachu:** Once the battle is resolved, the next step is to immediately heal Pikachu. We need to find a Pokémon Center or use a Potion.
3.  **Resume Leveling:** After healing, we will resume the original goal of finding battles to level up Pikachu, assuming the bug does not reoccur. If the bug persists, we will need to find an alternate route or area to train.

## V. Contingency Plans

*   **If the Bug Persists:** If the Caterpie battle bug continues to impede progress, we may need to consider:
    *   Changing routes to avoid Caterpie encounters.
    *   Modifying the game state (if possible through emulator features) to remove the bugged battle instance.
    *   Seeking advice from online communities or forums familiar with Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen glitches.

## VI. Summary

Our progress is currently halted by a severe bug. The immediate focus is on resolving this issue so we can resume the original goal of leveling up Pikachu. Further investigation is needed to understand the cause of the bug and how to prevent it from happening again.
