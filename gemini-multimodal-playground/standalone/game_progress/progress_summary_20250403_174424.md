# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Route 2, near the entrance to Viridian Forest.
*   **Coordinates:** (7, 5)
*   **Screen Type:** Overworld
*   **Lead Pokémon:** HP unknown (assumed full after recent PC visit).
*   **Party Status:** No current battles.

## II. Recent Actions & Observations

*   **Initial Stuck State:** The first several turns were spent stuck in the Viridian City Pokémon Center, apparently in a loop repeatedly attempting to exit. This issue has been resolved.
*   **Location Change:** Successfully transitioned from inside the Viridian City Pokémon Center to Route 2. This was achieved by moving "Down" from the PC.
*   **Weedle Encounter(s):** At some point, the player encountered a Weedle in tall grass and defeated it. The game got stuck showing the battle summary and needed repeated inputs to continue.
*   **Battle Summary Loop:** Turns 27-31 were spent repeatedly pressing 'A' to clear the battle summary screen after defeating a Weedle. This suggests the need for more efficient battle summary handling in future turns.

## III. Key Discoveries & Challenges

*   **Navigation Challenge:** Initial difficulty exiting the Pokémon Center highlights a potential issue with spatial awareness and action execution.
*   **Weedle Encounter:** Encountered and defeated a wild Weedle. This confirms that random encounters are working.
*   **Battle Summary Handling:** The game's battle summary screen gets stuck. Repeated pressing of 'A' is required, showing opportunity to automate this process and make the game more efficient.

## IV. Next Objectives

1.  **Enter Viridian Forest:** Move directly north into Viridian Forest's tall grass.
2.  **Search for Pikachu:** Explore the tall grass of Viridian Forest, triggering random encounters, and specifically aiming to find a Pikachu.
3.  **Catch Pikachu:** Once a Pikachu is encountered, initiate battle and attempt to capture it. Ensure Poké Balls are available for this purpose.
4.  **Monitor HP:** Keep track of the lead Pokémon's HP during encounters and battles. If HP gets low, consider retreating to the Viridian City Pokémon Center for healing.
5.  **Implement Strategy for clearing the summary:** Ensure an efficient way to deal with the battle summary, so repeated presses of 'A' can be automated.
