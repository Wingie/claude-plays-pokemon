# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

**Current Status:**

*   Engaged in a battle against Bug Catcher Doug and his Kakuna.
*   Our active Pokémon is Mankey, currently at 20/26 HP.
*   Repeatedly using the move "SCRATCH" against Kakuna.

**Recent Actions (Turns 60-69):**

*   **Turn 60-69:** Focused on attacking Kakuna using Mankey's "SCRATCH" move.
    *   Each turn involved: selecting "FIGHT", choosing "SCRATCH", and progressing through the battle prompts.
    *   The battle is ongoing, and no significant progress (e.g., defeating the Kakuna) has been made.

**Key Discoveries/Observations:**

*   Kakuna appears to be a persistent opponent in this battle.
*   Mankey's "SCRATCH" move is the primary offensive strategy currently employed.
*   The battle progression involves selecting moves and advancing the battle flow through button presses.

**Challenges:**

*   Stuck in a repetitive loop of using "SCRATCH" against Kakuna without a clear indication of progress or victory.
*   Mankey's HP remains static, suggesting a lack of significant damage dealt to Kakuna.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Assess Battle Effectiveness:** Determine if "SCRATCH" is an effective move against Kakuna. If not, explore alternative strategies.
2.  **Consider Alternative Moves:** Experiment with "LOW KICK" to see if it's more effective against Kakuna.
3.  **Strategic Shift:** If neither "SCRATCH" nor "LOW KICK" prove successful, consider:
    *   Using "LEER" to lower Kakuna's defense before attacking.
    *   Switching to a different Pokémon if available and advantageous.
    *   Evaluate running if the battle is unwinnable and resources are dwindling.
4.  **Win the Battle:** The primary objective remains to defeat Bug Catcher Doug's Kakuna and progress further in the game.
