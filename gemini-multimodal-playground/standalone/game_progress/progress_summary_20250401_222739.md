# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Head north to Viridian City and locate the Poké Mart with a blue roof.

**Current Status:** Currently engaged in a prolonged battle with a Level 4 Rattata. Charmander is level 9 with 18/27 HP.

## Recent Actions:

*   **Initial Encounter:** A wild Rattata was encountered, interrupting the journey north.
*   **Combat Attempts:**
    *   Repeated attempts to use the "Scratch" attack.
    *   Tried using "Ember" for potentially super-effective damage.
    *   Multiple confirmations and "A" button presses to continue attacking.
*   **Strategic Diversion:** Seemingly ended up on the Pokémon info screen for Charmander. Attempted to navigate back to the battle screen using "Cancel" and the "B" button.
*   **Back to basics:** Selected fight again.

## Key Discoveries & Insights:

*   **Battle System:** Familiarization with the battle interface, including the FIGHT, BAG, POKéMON, and RUN options.
*   **Type Effectiveness:** Recognition that Ember (Fire-type) might be super-effective against Rattata (Normal-type).
*   **Navigational Challenges:** Difficulty navigating menus and battle screens efficiently. The player inadvertently accessed the Pokémon information screen and struggled to return to the fight.
*   **Persistence Required:** The Rattata battle has been surprisingly persistent, indicating it's not a quick victory.

## Challenges Faced:

*   **Prolonged Battle:** The battle with the Rattata is taking longer than expected, hindering progress toward the primary objective.
*   **Menu Navigation:** Inexperience with the game's menu system led to getting lost within the Pokémon information screen.
*   **HP management:** Concern over Charmander's HP, the rattata is proving to be a worthy opponent.

## Next Objectives:

1.  **Defeat the Rattata:** Prioritize ending the current battle to resume the journey to Viridian City.
2.  **Optimize Battle Strategy:** Re-evaluate the choice of attacks. Continue using Ember.
3.  **Learn Menu Navigation:** Improve familiarity with the game's menu system to avoid getting lost in the future.
4.  **Continue North:** Once the battle is won, resume the original objective of heading north towards Viridian City.
5.  **Locate the Poké Mart:** Upon reaching Viridian City, find the Poké Mart with the distinct blue roof.
