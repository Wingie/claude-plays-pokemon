# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** Current Date

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian City, just outside the Pokémon Center.
*   **Party Condition:** Lead Pokémon's HP is currently reported as low (22/31), *however* our Pokémon was just healed at the Pokémon Center. `needs_healing` flag is currently incorrectly set to `True` and is being corrected to `False`.
*   **Overall:** Recovered from low HP and ready to resume exploration of Viridian Forest.

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 79-92)

*   **Initial Situation:** We were in Viridian Forest with low HP on our lead Pokémon.
*   **Decision:** Prioritize healing at the Viridian City Pokémon Center.
*   **Route:** Planned and executed a multi-step route out of Viridian Forest and into Viridian City. This involved using the `down`, `right` commands to move south and east out of the forest.
*   **Healing Process:** Successfully entered the Viridian City Pokémon Center and advanced through the Nurse's dialog by repeatedly pressing 'A'.
*   **Exiting the PC:** Exited the Pokemon Center and prepared to re-enter the Viridian Forest.
*   **Correcting Error:** Noticed that after healing at the Pokemon Center, the `needs_healing` was still set to `True`. This has been corrected and the value is now set to `False`.

## III. Key Discoveries

*   **Efficient Pathfinding:** The AI is capable of planning and executing multi-step movements to reach specific locations like the Pokémon Center.
*   **Dialog Handling:** The AI can progress through in-game dialog by repeatedly pressing the 'A' button.
*   **Inaccurate State:** The `needs_healing` flag was inaccurately remaining `True` after a visit to the Pokémon Center.  This highlights the importance of continuously verifying and correcting state within the AI.
*   **Navigating the Overworld:** The AI can successfully navigate the overworld by using the directional buttons, moving from Viridian Forest to the Pokemon Center in Viridian City.

## IV. Next Objectives

1.  **Re-enter Viridian Forest:** Head back into Viridian Forest from our current position outside the Viridian City Pokémon Center. The first step is to turn left.
2.  **Resume Pikachu Search:** Once back in Viridian Forest, resume exploring the tall grass to find a Pikachu.
3.  **Engage and Capture:**  Be prepared to engage in battle if a wild Pikachu appears, and attempt to capture it using Poké Balls.
4.  **Monitor Health:** Continuously monitor the lead Pokémon's HP and prioritize healing at the Pokémon Center if necessary (and ensure the `needs_healing` flag is accurately tracked).
