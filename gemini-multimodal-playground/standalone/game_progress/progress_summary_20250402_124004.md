# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

Currently engaged in a battle strategy focused on repeated use of Pidgey's "Tackle" attack against wild RATTATA. While successful, the strategy is monotonous and may not be optimal in the long run. Pidgey has gained experience.

## Recent Actions (Turns 35-44)

*   Repeatedly engaged in a single battle against a wild RATTATA.
*   Selected the first attack option (Tackle) for Pidgey in each turn.
*   Successfully defeated the RATTATA after multiple rounds of combat.
*   Observed Pidgey gaining 16 experience points after the battle.

## Key Discoveries

*   "Tackle" is a viable attack, at least against weak opponents like RATTATA.
*   Battles provide experience points, which contribute to Pokémon growth.
*   The game requires advancing the dialogue after key events like a Pokémon fainting or gaining experience.

## Challenges

*   **Strategic Depth:** The current strategy relies solely on spamming a single attack. Exploring different attack options and their effectiveness against various Pokémon types is necessary.
*   **Monotony:** Repeating the same action in each turn can be tedious. Introducing variability in attack selection or targeting could improve engagement.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Diversify Attack Strategies:** Experiment with other available attacks (if any) to understand their damage output and effectiveness.
2.  **Explore Different Wild Pokémon:** Seek out battles with various Pokémon types to identify strengths and weaknesses of Pidgey's attacks and learn type matchups.
3.  **Identify Healing Mechanisms:** Investigate ways to heal Pidgey after battles to sustain longer exploration periods.
4.  **Progress Beyond the Starting Area:**  Once confident in basic battle mechanics, begin exploring beyond the initial area to discover new locations and challenges.
