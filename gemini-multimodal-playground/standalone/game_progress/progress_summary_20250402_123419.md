# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

Currently engaged in a battle, but experiencing significant challenges. Our Pidgey has fainted and we are attempting to switch to Charmander. The primary issue seems to be correctly navigating the menu prompts to select and send out Charmander after Pidgey's defeat.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turn 80-81:** Initiated battle with a wild Pidgey. Attempted to attack (using "A").
*   **Turn 82-89:** Pidgey fainted during the battle. Attempted multiple times to switch to Charmander. Actions primarily involved responding to prompts ("Use next POKéMON?", "Choose a POKéMON?", "Do what with this POKéMON?") and repeatedly selecting Charmander (pressing 'A' when it is the top option).

## Key Discoveries

*   **Fainting:** Discovered what happens when a Pokémon's health reaches zero (fainting).
*   **Pokémon Switching:** The game prompts for a new Pokémon when the active one faints. Understanding the flow of menu options following a faint is crucial for continued battling.
*   **Menu Navigation:** The "A" button appears to be used for confirming selections within the menus.
*   **HP Awareness:** Charmander's current HP is 29/29, indicating it is at full health and ready to battle.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Pokémon Fainting:** Pidgey fainted, hindering progress.
*   **Menu Navigation Confusion:** Difficulty correctly executing the Pokémon switch after Pidgey's defeat. There appears to be a disconnect between the intention to switch to Charmander and the successful execution of this action within the game's menus. The repetition in Turns 82-89 suggests a misunderstanding or input error in the switching process.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Successfully Switch to Charmander:** Ensure the successful deployment of Charmander in the ongoing battle. This requires understanding the prompts following Pidgey's fainting and correctly navigating the selection and "SEND OUT" options.
2.  **Engage in Battle with Charmander:** Once Charmander is deployed, begin attacking the wild Pidgey to gain experience and work towards winning the battle.
3.  **Improve Understanding of Battle Mechanics:** Focus on understanding different attack options, their effectiveness, and any status effects that might occur.
4.  **Avoid Future Fainting:** Develop strategies to keep Pokémon alive during battles. This could involve using potions (once available), switching Pokémon strategically, or prioritizing effective attacks.
