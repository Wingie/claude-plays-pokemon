# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Reach the Poké Mart with the blue roof in Viridian City.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Route 1, Overworld. Coordinates (7, 10).
*   **Surroundings:** Tall grass, with a ledge to the west (left) and trees to the east (right).
*   **Progress:** Minor progress heading north, but encountering navigation challenges due to terrain.

## Recent Actions (Turns 55-64)

*   **Initial Strategy:** Attempting to move directly north towards Viridian City.
*   **Problem Encountered:** Initially became stuck, repeating the same location and facing movement restrictions likely due to an invisible barrier and the configuration of the ledge and trees.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Attempts to circumvent the barrier by moving right, then left, were made, but these efforts were initially erratic and didn't lead to progress.
*   **Successful Maneuver:** Eventually, after correcting pathing issues, moving right then north finally led to a change in coordinates, breaking out of the previously stuck position.

## Key Discoveries and Insights

*   **Terrain Limitations:** Route 1 features challenging terrain, with a combination of tall grass, trees, and ledges that can hinder straightforward northward progress.
*   **Coordination Challenges:** It's possible to become stuck in a loop if pathing is not carefully planned around obstacles.
*   **Importance of Persistence:** Even after a few missteps and loops, adjusting the strategy to carefully navigate around the obstacle has resulted in some progress.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue North:** Resume the northward trajectory towards Viridian City, prioritizing avoiding the ledge and trees.
2.  **Careful Navigation:** Pay close attention to coordinate changes to confirm progress and avoid getting stuck again.
3.  **Reach Viridian City:** Upon entering Viridian City, immediately locate the Poké Mart with the blue roof to complete the current primary goal.

## Notes

While the recent turns encountered some challenges, persistence in trying new movement patterns and then executing them in sequence allowed progress to continue. A more focused approach may be beneficial to prevent getting stuck.
