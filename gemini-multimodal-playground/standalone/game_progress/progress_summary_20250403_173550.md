# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Pikachu Hunt

**Current Status:**

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest (Coordinates: 11, 4)
*   **Objective:** Catch a Pikachu.
*   **In Tall Grass:** Yes.  We are now encountering wild Pokémon.
*   **Recent Battle:** Fought and defeated a Weedle. Currently stuck clearing the battle summary screen.
*   **Pokémon Condition:** Unknown (HP needs assessment after clearing battle summary)
*   **Poké Ball Count:** Unknown (Needs inventory check)
*   **Healing Status:** Unknown (Needs HP assessment after battles). Assuming not needing healing immediately.

**Recent Actions & Summary:**

*   **Turns 0-4:** Initial exploration focused on entering the tall grass of Viridian Forest. Repeatedly attempted to move upwards to enter the tall grass.
*   **Turns 5-21:** (Missing, but presumably involved wild Pokémon encounters and battles).
*   **Turns 22-26:** Successfully defeated a Weedle.  Currently, the system is stuck in the Battle Summary screen, repeatedly attempting to clear it by pressing 'A'.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   **Confirmed Location:** Viridian Forest is the current location.
*   **Wild Pokémon:** We have encountered at least one Weedle. This confirms that the area has active Pokémon.
*   **Navigation Success:** Successfully navigated into tall grass.
*   **Obstacle:** Encountered difficulties transitioning out of the Battle Summary Screen. Likely the agent is stuck in a loop.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Initial Navigation:**  Several turns were spent simply trying to enter the tall grass.
*   **Battle Summary Loop:** Unable to exit the Battle Summary screen after defeating the Weedle. This prevents further exploration and potentially consumes unnecessary actions.
*   **Missing Information:** Lack of information on Pokémon HP and Poké Ball count hampers strategic decisions.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Resolve Battle Summary Issue:** The priority is to escape the stuck Battle Summary screen. This may require a new strategy or a direct command override to force a return to the overworld.
2.  **Assess Pokémon Condition:** Once back in the overworld, immediately check the lead Pokémon's HP and determine if healing is required.
3.  **Check Poké Ball Count:** Confirm the number of available Poké Balls.
4.  **Continue Pikachu Search:** Resume exploring the tall grass in Viridian Forest with the intent to find and catch a Pikachu.
5.  **Strategic Refinement:** If Pikachu is not found relatively quickly, consider optimizing the search pattern to cover more ground efficiently.

**Insights & Strategic Considerations:**

*   **Efficiency:** Streamlining navigation and reducing redundant actions is crucial.
*   **Information Gathering:**  Prioritize gathering essential information about Pokémon HP and item counts.
*   **Battle Strategy:**  Prepare for potential battles while searching for Pikachu. Ensure the lead Pokémon is sufficiently leveled to handle common Viridian Forest encounters.
*   **Contingency Plan:** If the Battle Summary loop persists, consider adding a timeout mechanism to automatically reset the state. Also, consider a "force overworld" action for emergencies.
