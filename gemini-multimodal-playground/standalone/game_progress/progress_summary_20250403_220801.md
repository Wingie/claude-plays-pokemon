# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 80-89

**Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon

## Current Status

*   Engaged in battle, but Pikachu's health is critically low (11/20 HP).
*   `needs_healing = true`.
*   Repeatedly attempting to flee battle.

## Recent Actions

*   Repeatedly attempted to run from battle (Turns 80-89).
    *   Action taken each turn: Select "RUN" in the battle menu (Down, Down, A).

## Key Discoveries

*   Pikachu is consistently encountering battles where it sustains significant damage, likely hindering progress towards leveling up.
*   Escape attempts have been unsuccessful so far.

## Challenges

*   **Low Health:** Pikachu's low health is the primary obstacle, preventing effective engagement in battles.
*   **Failed Escape Attempts:** The inability to successfully run from battles is prolonging the risk to Pikachu and preventing healing.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Successful Escape:** Prioritize successfully escaping the current battle.
2.  **Immediate Healing:** Once the battle is escaped, immediately heal Pikachu at a Pokémon Center.
3.  **Re-evaluate Leveling Strategy:** After healing, reassess the current leveling location and strategy. Consider:
    *   Exploring areas with weaker Pokémon to minimize damage.
    *   Utilizing healing items more proactively during battles if running is proving difficult.
    *   Potentially training a different, more resilient Pokémon to assist with leveling.

## Insights

*   The current battle encounter is proving too difficult or unavoidable for Pikachu at its current level.
*   A more cautious approach to leveling is required to avoid repeated critical health situations.
*   Potentially consider stocking up on healing items (Potions) to facilitate leveling without needing to return to a Pokemon Center as frequently.
