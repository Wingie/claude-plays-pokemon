# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Route 1 (North of Pallet Town, South of Viridian City)
*   **Party:**
    *   Charmander (Level unknown, HP 9/27)
*   **Objective:** Travel north to Viridian City and catch a Pidgey.

## Recent Actions

*   **Repeatedly engaged Wild Pidgey in battle.** The primary strategy has been to use Ember, which, unfortunately, consistently causes the Pidgey to faint before a Pokéball can be thrown.
*   **Made minimal progress towards Viridian City.** The frequency of Pidgey encounters is slowing our advance.
*   **Exited battle loop with 'a'.** Player was stuck in battle

## Key Discoveries

*   **Pidgey are common on Route 1.** Encounters are frequent, although not always successful.
*   **Charmander's Ember is too strong.** It consistently defeats Pidgey before they can be weakened enough for capture. This highlights the need for a different strategy.
*   **Route 1 can cause player to get stuck in a battle loop** Acknowledged as a bug, but battle ended.

## Challenges

*   **Failed Pidgey Captures:** Repeatedly failing to catch Pidgey due to accidentally knocking them out.
*   **Low Charmander HP:** Charmander has only 9/27 HP
*   **Route 1 can cause player to get stuck in a battle loop** Acknowledged as a bug, but battle ended.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Reach Viridian City:** Continue moving north, prioritizing arrival at the city.
2.  **Revise Pidgey Capture Strategy:** Avoid using Ember initially.  Consider:
    *   Using a weaker move (if available).
    *   Leveling up Charmander to increase its HP and defensive stats, thereby surviving longer battles and using multiple attacks to catch Pidgey
    *   Alternatively, acquire Pokéballs and try using them immediately without weakening the Pidgey first, accepting the lower capture probability.
3.  **Heal Charmander:** Upon reaching Viridian City, heal Charmander at the Pokémon Center.
4.  **Explore Viridian City:** Investigate the city for useful items, information, and potential side quests.
