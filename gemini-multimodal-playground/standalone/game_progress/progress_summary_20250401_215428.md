# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** Current Date

**Game:** Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, coordinates (8, 9)
*   **Surroundings:** Tall grass, ledge to the left (west), trees to the right (east).
*   **Overall Progress:** Still navigating Route 1 towards Viridian City.

## Recent Actions (Turns 50-59)

*   **Initial Position:** Started in the overworld at coordinates (6, 11), surrounded by tall grass with trees to the right and a ledge blocking the northern path.
*   **Navigation Attempts:** Initial plan was to circumvent the obstacle to the north of the starting location.
    *   Attempted moving left to go around the obstacle.
    *   Then, a series of attempts were made to move north, but the ledge proved to be an impassable barrier. This resulted in multiple turns spent in the same location, suggesting a loop.
    *   Tried moving right to navigate around the trees to bypass the ledge.
    *   Moved up once again.

## Key Discoveries/Challenges

*   **Ledge Obstacle:** A significant ledge is blocking direct northward progress. This requires strategic navigation.
*   **Looping Behavior:** Repeatedly attempting to move north directly into the ledge resulted in remaining stuck at the same location. This highlights the importance of carefully observing the environment and adapting the strategy when movement fails.
*   **Importance of Spatial Awareness:** Coordinates were not changing when moving north to go past ledge.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Reach Viridian City:** Primary objective remains reaching Viridian City.
2.  **Find the Blue-Roofed Poké Mart:** Once in Viridian City, locate the Poké Mart with the blue roof.
3.  **Successful Navigation:** Focus on clear, deliberate movements to avoid getting stuck. Re-evaluate the surroundings after each step to confirm progress. If stuck, retrace steps.

## Strategy Adjustments

*   **Adaptive Movement:** Avoid repeating the same action if it doesn't lead to progress. If the character appears stuck, try an alternative direction immediately.
*   **Visual Cues:** Prioritize using visual landmarks (trees, ledges) to guide movement, rather than solely relying on the directional input.

## Outlook

Progress has been slow due to navigation challenges. However, by prioritizing strategic thinking and obstacle avoidance, we should be able to reach Viridian City soon.
