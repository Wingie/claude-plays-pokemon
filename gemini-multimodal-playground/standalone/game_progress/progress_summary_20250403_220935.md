# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report (Turns 90-99)

**Current Goal:** Level up our Pokémon.

## Current Status

*   Pikachu's health is critically low (11/20).
*   Engaged in battles where fleeing is the priority.
*   No progress made towards leveling up due to consistently needing to run.

## Recent Actions (Turns 90-99)

*   Repeated attempts to flee from battles to protect Pikachu.
*   The specific method employed to flee involves pressing "Down" twice and then "A".
*   No successful battles completed.

## Key Discoveries

*   Pikachu is consistently encountering opponents that pose a significant threat, preventing it from effectively leveling up.
*   The "Run" command is accessible by pressing "Down" twice from the initial battle menu.
*   Repeated fleeing from battle.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Low Pokémon Health:** Pikachu's low HP prevents engaging in sustained battles and leveling up.
*   **Difficult Encounters:** The encountered Pokémon are apparently too strong for Pikachu in its current state.
*   **Lack of Healing Items/Location:** No mention of healing items or a Pokémon Center visit has been made.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Heal Pikachu:** Prioritize restoring Pikachu's health to full (or near full). This could involve:
    *   Using a Potion or other healing item.
    *   Visiting a Pokémon Center to heal.  This may involve navigating to a previous location.
2.  **Identify Easier Training Areas:** Locate areas with weaker Pokémon that Pikachu can reliably defeat to gain experience.
3.  **Consider Alternative Pokémon:** If available, consider switching to a different, healthier Pokémon for training.
4.  **Acquire Healing Items:** Obtain a steady supply of Potions or similar healing items to maintain Pikachu's (or other Pokémon's) health during training.
