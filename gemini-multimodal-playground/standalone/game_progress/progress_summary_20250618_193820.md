# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Level up Pikachu through battles.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently stuck in a battle loop.
*   **Party:** Pikachu is our active Pokémon.
*   **Pikachu's Status:** HP at 14/20. Needs healing after exiting the battle.
*   **Battle Status:** Currently engaged in battle with a fainted CATERPIE, but the game is bugged and will not exit the battle.

## Recent Actions (Turns 75-84)

The last ten turns have been focused on attempting to exit a bugged battle. In each turn, after defeating a wild CATERPIE, the game has failed to progress beyond the move selection screen, leaving Pikachu stuck in a perpetual battle state. The consistent action taken has been to attempt to advance the dialogue by pressing the "A" button, in an attempt to force the game to acknowledge the battle's end.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Game-Breaking Bug:** A significant bug has been encountered where the game fails to properly end battles after the opponent Pokémon has fainted. This loop prevents further progression.
*   **Re-Healing Necessity:** The persistent loop also ensures that Pikachu remains at low HP, creating additional incentive to leave battle when able.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Battle Loop:** The primary challenge is the inability to exit the current battle. This prevents leveling up Pikachu and progressing in the game.
*   **Resource Management:** Wasting turns in this loop.
*   **Potential Solutions?** There are no obvious solutions to this bug.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Attempt to Escape the Battle Loop:** Continue to try and press 'A' to see if the game will eventually acknowledge the end of the battle.
2.  **Heal Pikachu:** Once (or if) the battle loop is broken, immediately seek out a Pokémon Center or use items to heal Pikachu's HP.
3.  **Explore Alternative Solutions:** If pressing 'A' repeatedly fails, explore potential alternative solutions, such as resetting the game or trying different button combinations in case there is a workaround we have not yet tried.
4.  **Re-Evaluate Leveling Strategy:** Depending on the source of the bug, it may be in our best interest to pursue an alternative to battling with Pikachu in the same area in order to progress past the battle loop.
