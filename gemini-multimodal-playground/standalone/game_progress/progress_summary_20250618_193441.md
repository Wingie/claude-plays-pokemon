# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Find battles to level up Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Trapped in a battle loop.
*   **Active Pokémon:** Pikachu
*   **Pikachu's HP:** 14/20 (Needs Healing)
*   **Opponent:**  Defeated Wild CATERPIE (appears to be a graphical bug)
*   **Battle Status:** Stuck on move selection screen after defeating the opponent.
*   **Overall Progress:** Stalled due to a persistent bug.

## Recent Actions (Turns 35-44)

The primary action across the last ten turns has been attempting to resolve a recurring bug encountered after defeating a Wild CATERPIE. The game becomes stuck on the move selection screen, even after the opposing Pokémon has fainted.  Each turn consisted of the following:

1.  **Observation:** Confirmed the battle loop, Pikachu's HP, and available moves.
2.  **Analysis:** Re-identified the bug and the need for healing after exiting the battle (if possible).
3.  **Plan:**  To press the "A" button to advance the dialogue and hopefully exit the battle.
4.  **Action:** Pressing the "A" button.

This action did *not* resolve the issue, leading to the repetition of the same observations and plan in subsequent turns.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Bug Encounter:** A significant bug prevents the game from progressing after a battle is won against a Caterpie. The battle screen remains stuck on move selection.
*   **Ineffective Strategy:** Repeatedly pressing the "A" button has proven ineffective in exiting the battle loop.
*   **Pikachu's Status:** Pikachu's health is low enough to require healing once the battle can be exited.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Troubleshooting the Bug:** Investigate potential solutions to bypass the battle loop. This may require:
    *   Trying different inputs/buttons besides "A".
    *   Attempting to run from the battle (if the option becomes available).
    *   Exploring if a forced reset is required (and potentially losing progress).
2.  **Healing Pikachu:** Once the battle is resolved, the immediate priority is to heal Pikachu at a Pokémon Center to ensure its survival in future battles.
3.  **Continue Leveling:** After healing, resume the primary objective of finding battles to level up Pikachu, but *avoid* battling Caterpie if possible.
4.  **Document Bug Circumstances:** Record the specific circumstances of the bug (e.g., location, moves used) to potentially identify a pattern and avoid it in the future.

## Long-Term Strategies

*   **Prioritize Healing:** Keep a close watch on Pikachu's HP and prioritize healing to minimize the risk of fainting.
*   **Adapt Battle Strategy:** Based on Pikachu's strengths and weaknesses, develop a strategic approach to battles that leverages its moves effectively.
*   **Save Frequently:** Due to the potential for bugs, save the game frequently to minimize potential loss of progress.

## Notes

The game's progress is currently stalled due to an unexpected bug. The immediate focus is on finding a workaround to resume normal gameplay. The circumstances of the bug need to be documented carefully to avoid similar situations in the future. If the bug persists, consider restarting the ROM.
