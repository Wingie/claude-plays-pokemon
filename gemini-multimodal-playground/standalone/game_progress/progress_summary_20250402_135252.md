# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Pikachu Hunt

**Current Status:**

*   Location: Viridian Forest
*   Objective: Find and catch a Pikachu.
*   Progress: Initial exploration of tall grass in Viridian Forest. Encountering wild Pidgey.
*   Coordinates: Currently at (2, 11).

**Recent Actions:**

*   Turns 0, 1: Entered battle with wild Pidgey. Selected "Fight" and first available move (implicitly).
*   Turns 2, 3: Exited the battle summary screen by pressing 'A'. (Pidgey leveling up notification.)
*   Turns 4, 5, 6, 7, 8: Repeatedly moved randomly through the tall grass in Viridian Forest, attempting to trigger wild Pokémon encounters.  Specifically:
    *   Turn 4: Up, Right, Up.
    *   Turn 5: Right, Down, Right.
    *   Turn 6: Up, Right, Up.
    *   Turn 7: [Movement steps unknown but assumed random]

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Wild Pidgey are common encounters in the starting area of Viridian Forest.
*   Randomly moving within tall grass triggers wild Pokémon battles.
*   Battle summary screens require pressing 'A' to dismiss.
*   Current location can be tracked and is important for planning movement.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   Lack of information about available moves in battle necessitates selecting options blindly.
*   No Pikachu encountered thus far despite continued exploration.
*   Repetitive nature of random movement for triggering encounters.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Continue exploring Viridian Forest:** Maintain focus on moving through tall grass areas.
2.  **Optimize Movement:** Consider whether a more systematic exploration pattern would be more effective than random movement.
3.  **Identify Pikachu Habitat:** If possible, research or look for clues about where Pikachu are more likely to appear within the forest.
4.  **Prepare for Pikachu Encounter:** Ensure the party has Poké Balls available for capture and a strategy for weakening Pikachu without knocking it out.
5.  **Document Battle Tactics:** Begin documenting move effectiveness and available options during battle to improve decision-making.
