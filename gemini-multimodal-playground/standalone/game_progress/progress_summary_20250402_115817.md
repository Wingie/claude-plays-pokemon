# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Locate and capture a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently on Route 1.
*   **Pokémon:** Party includes HAN (Level 3, 15/15 HP, assumed name "MAN" due to potential OCR error in previous turns.)
*   **Progress:** Initial exploration hindered by being stuck on a rock formation. After repeated attempts, we've navigated off the ledge and are now in a grassy area.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 25-28:** Attempted to navigate off a rock formation using various movement directions (South, West).
*   **Turn 29:** Successfully navigated off the rock formation and found ourselves in a grassy area (likely Route 1). Identified a ledge to the south, trees to the east, and a rocky area to the west.
*   **Turns 30-31:** Encountered a wild Ratata (Level 4). Attempted to run away due to the level difference and the unknown state of our Pokémon at first (Turn 30). Once HP was known, still attempted to flee (Turn 31).
*   **Turns 32-34:** Accidentally opened the Pokémon menu (likely due to pressing the wrong button or a misinterpretation of the game state). Repeatedly selected "CANCEL" to exit the menu and return to exploration.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Terrain:** Route 1 is characterized by grassy areas, ledges, trees, and rocky formations.
*   **Wild Pokémon:** Encounters with wild Ratata (Level 4) indicate common Pokémon found in the area.
*   **Navigation Challenges:** Ledges and rock formations pose obstacles to exploration, requiring strategic movement.
*   **Menu System:** Inadvertently accessed the Pokémon menu, highlighting the need for careful button presses and an understanding of the user interface.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Explore Route 1:** Focus on exploring the grassy areas north of the current location, as these are the most likely habitats for Pikachu.
2.  **Avoid Unnecessary Battles:** Given the level difference with wild Ratata and the limited information about our Pokémon's moves, prioritize avoiding battles until we can heal/level up.
3.  **Learn the User Interface:** Become more familiar with the game's menus to prevent accidental access and ensure efficient navigation.
4.  **Continue southward.** There is a second ledge we can jump that leads in a different direction. This will expand our exploration
