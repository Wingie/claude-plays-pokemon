# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on the "recent" game turns provided)

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, Route 1 (estimated), coordinates (9, 10)
*   **Objective:** Reach Viridian City and find the PokeMart with the blue roof.
*   **Party:**
    *   Charmander: Level 9, 18/27 HP (Only confirmed team member)
*   **Environment:** Surrounded by tall grass, with trees to the east and a ledge to the west, obstructing direct northward movement.

## Recent Actions (Turns 45-54 Summary)

*   **Combat:** Engaged in a prolonged battle with a wild Pidgey. Charmander repeatedly used Scratch until the Pidgey fainted.
*   **Navigation:**
    *   Exited battle and resumed northward journey.
    *   Encountered a ledge blocking the direct path north.
    *   Attempted to circumvent the ledge by moving left (failed) and then continued attempts to move up to navigate around the obstacle
*   **World State:** Coordinates tracking initiated.

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Obstacles:** The game world presents obstacles like ledges, hindering direct movement and requiring strategic navigation.
*   **Combat Efficiency:** Charmander's Scratch attack is effective against early-game Pokémon like Pidgey, but battles can be lengthy.
*   **Location Tracking:** Coordinate system can be used to track movement
*   **Repetitive Input:** Multiple turns were wasted attempting the same movement with no effect.

## Next Objectives & Strategy

1.  **Continued Navigation:**
    *   Continue trying to move north to circumvent the ledge.
    *   If directly moving up fails, explore a wider area, moving east or west to find a path around the ledge and north towards Viridian City.
2.  **Viridian City Arrival:**
    *   Upon reaching Viridian City, prioritize locating the PokeMart with the blue roof.
3.  **PokeMart Interaction:**
    *   Once inside the PokeMart, evaluate current inventory and purchase necessary items (Potions, Poké Balls).

## Actionable Items

*   Explore movement to the east to circumvent the ledge
*   Explore movement to the west to circumvent the ledge

## Notes

*   Charmander's health (18/27 HP) is not optimal. Avoiding unnecessary battles until reaching Viridian City is recommended.
*   Conserve PP (Power Points) of Scratch by avoiding prolonged fights.
*   Prioritize finding Poké Balls to capture new Pokémon and expand the party.
