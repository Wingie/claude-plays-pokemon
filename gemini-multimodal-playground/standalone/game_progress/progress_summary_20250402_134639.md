# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore the world and encounter a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Unknown. We are currently stuck in wild encounters.
*   **Lead Pokémon:** Pidgey, Level 9, HP: 15/27.
*   **Healing Status:** Needs Healing. Pidgey's HP is below 30% of its maximum, requiring a visit to a Pokémon Center.
*   **Progress Towards Goal:** Minimal. Focus shifted from Pikachu search to survival and healing.
*   **Pokeball Count**: Unknown

## II. Recent Actions & Observations

We have been stuck in a loop of wild Rattata encounters.  The initial strategy was to battle each Rattata for experience points, pressing "A" to fight and then "A" again to select the first available move (assumed to be an attack).  However, Pidgey's HP has dwindled to the point where healing is now a critical priority.

Specific observations from recent turns:

*   **Turn 0-3:**  Engaged in battles with Rattata, attempting to gain EXP, using the first move.  We identified "Gust" as potentially the best offensive move once the available moves were listed.
*   **Turn 4-9:** Recognizing the low HP, the strategy shifted from battling to escaping. Attempts to run from battle by pressing "B" or selecting "RUN" failed, and battles continued. In an attempt to end the battle quickly, we resorted to using the first move again.

## III. Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Persistence of Encounters:** Wild encounters with Rattata are frequent, hindering exploration.
*   **Healing Priority:** Low HP significantly impacts strategic decision-making, forcing a shift from exploration to self-preservation.
*   **Unsuccessful Escape Attempts:** Running from battle is proving difficult. We haven't successfully escaped a battle yet.
*   **First Move Strategy Ineffective:** Spamming the first move is not an effective long-term strategy, especially with low HP.

## IV. Next Objectives

1.  **Escape the Current Battle:** The immediate priority is to successfully run from the current Rattata encounter. We need to review the correct button sequence or strategy for escaping.
2.  **Locate and Reach a Pokémon Center:** After escaping, navigate to the nearest Pokémon Center to heal Pidgey. Since our location is unknown, this may involve exploring in a specific direction until we find a familiar area.  We need to establish a direction to travel and stick with it until landmarks are recognized.
3.  **Re-evaluate Pikachu Search Strategy:** Once Pidgey is healed, re-assess the best areas to search for Pikachu and develop a more efficient method of exploration, potentially involving using repels to minimize wild encounters or changing the lead pokemon.

## V. Challenges & Solutions

*   **Challenge:**  Frequent wild encounters preventing exploration.
    *   **Potential Solution:** Consider using Repels once available to reduce encounter rates, but this is limited by the need to find a Pokemart.
*   **Challenge:** Low HP making battles risky.
    *   **Solution:** Prioritize healing and potentially catch and train other Pokémon to diversify the team and provide backup.
*   **Challenge:** Inability to escape battles.
    *   **Solution:** Verify the correct button sequence for running.  If running fails, consider using items like Poké Dolls (if available) or switching to a different Pokémon (if any).
*   **Challenge:** Unknown Location
    *   **Solution:** Pick a direction (Up, Down, Left, or Right) and stick with it, hoping to trigger familiar area/location for navigation to the nearest PokeCenter.
