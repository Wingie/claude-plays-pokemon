# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 35 - 44

**Current Goal:** Explore the world and encounter a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently in tall grass, exploring.
*   **Pokémon:**
    *   Pidgey: HP 15/27 (Above 30% health, no immediate healing needed).
*   **Overall:** Actively searching for Pokémon in the tall grass, but yet to encounter anything beyond rattatas.

## II. Recent Actions & Notable Events

*   **Repeated Encounters with Rattata:** Several consecutive turns were spent battling a wild Rattata. This indicates either a high encounter rate for Rattata in the current area or a string of bad luck.
*   **Strategic Battling:** Consistently used Tackle (assumed to be Pidgey's default move) as the primary attack.
*   **HP Management:** Monitoring Pidgey's HP after battles and implementing a check to determine if healing is necessary. HP has remained above the 30% threshold, so no healing has been required.
*   **Continued Exploration:** After defeating the Rattata, resumed exploration of the tall grass, moving in various directions.

## III. Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Rattata Prevalence:** Rattata appear to be very common in the current area. This makes them useful for grinding EXP but hinders the primary goal of finding a Pikachu.
*   **Tackle Effectiveness:** Tackle has proven effective against Rattata, though battles can be drawn out, leading to some HP loss.
*   **Overworld Navigation:** Limited information available. The exact location is unknown, but the player is actively trying to navigate the tall grass.

## IV. Challenges Faced

*   **Finding Pikachu:** The primary challenge remains encountering a Pikachu. The high encounter rate of Rattata is proving to be an obstacle.
*   **HP Management in Prolonged Encounters:** Continued battles with Rattata, even if successful, gradually deplete Pidgey's HP. Strategic decisions will be necessary if more challenging Pokémon are encountered.
*   **Lack of Information on Location:** The player cannot determine their exact location on the map.

## V. Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Exploring Tall Grass:** Persist in exploring the tall grass, hoping to trigger an encounter with a Pikachu. The current plan is to travel up to try and find a wild pokemon.
2.  **Monitor HP:** Carefully monitor Pidgey's HP after each battle. If it drops below 30%, prioritize finding a Pokémon Center to heal.
3.  **Consider Alternate Locations:** If Pikachu encounters remain elusive, research and consider moving to different locations known for Pikachu spawns.
4. **Move Strategically:** Continue to move around to try and trigger an encounter with any wild pokemon.
