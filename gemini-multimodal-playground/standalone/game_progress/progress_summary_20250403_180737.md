# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Tall Grass, Location Name Unknown, Coordinates (4,7)
*   **Activity:** Engaged in battle.
*   **Party Leader:** Pidgey (Level 12, HP: 31/33)
*   **Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 0-2:** Random movement within tall grass to trigger wild Pokémon encounters. Initial objective was to find a Pikachu, but that seems to have been abandoned.
*   **Turn 3:** Encountered a wild Pikachu (initial objective reached!).
*   **Turns 42-47:** Currently battling a Caterpie. Repeatedly attempting to use Tackle with Pidgey.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Pikachu Encountered:** Initial objective (finding a Pikachu) was temporarily reached, although the current goal is leveling.
*   **Persistent Caterpie Encounter:**  Stuck in a repetitive battle loop against a Caterpie. The gameplan is consistently to use Tackle, however it seems we have not successfully completed the battle after 6 turns.

## Challenges

*   **Repetitive Battle Loop:**  The primary challenge is being stuck in a repeated battle against Caterpie and not being able to defeat it. The analysis and planned action are being run multiple times, but the battle does not resolve.
*   **Lack of Variety:**  Focus on repeated tackle might be inefficient.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Break the Battle Loop:** Determine why the Caterpie battle is not resolving. Debug the battle logic or consider alternative battle strategies. Is Tackle actually being executed? Is Caterpie healing? Are we in a state where nothing is happening?
2.  **If Battle Unresolvable:**  If the Caterpie battle cannot be won (potential bug?), identify a way to flee or reset the game state.
3.  **Alternative Leveling Strategy:** Once the battle is resolved, consider diversifying leveling strategies beyond simply using tackle.
    *   **Potion Use:** If HP is low during battles, use potions.
    *   **Type Advantage:**  Consider catching more Pokémon to utilize type advantages in battles, making leveling more efficient.
    *   **Trainer Battles:** Explore nearby trainers for potentially easier or more rewarding leveling opportunities.
