# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon

## Current Status

*   Currently engaged in repeated battles with Weedle.
*   Pikachu's HP is frequently low (11-14/20), indicating a need for healing.
*   Actively leveling up Pokémon through battling wild encounters.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turn 39-48:** Primarily focused on battling Weedle.
*   Selected "FIGHT" in the battle menu repeatedly.
*   Selected "THUNDERSHOCK" as the primary attack move.
*   Advanced dialog text after each attack by our Pokémon and the opponent (Weedle).
* Used GROWL at least twice, likely unintentionally given the goal of leveling up.

## Key Discoveries

*   **THUNDERSHOCK Effectiveness:** THUNDERSHOCK is consistently selected as the attack move, suggesting it's considered the most effective option currently available.
*   **Weedle as a Leveling Target:** Weedle appears to be the most frequent opponent encountered, chosen for leveling up purposes.
*   **Low HP Management:** Pikachu's frequent low HP (below 30% of max) indicates the need to monitor health and consider healing items or returning to a Pokémon Center.
*   **POISON STING Concern**: A Weedle used Poison Sting, which may inflict the poisoned status. Future turns should confirm if Pikachu is poisoned and the need to cure the status.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Leveling:** Persist in battling wild Pokémon, primarily targeting Weedle, to gain experience.
2.  **Prioritize THUNDERSHOCK:** Maintain THUNDERSHOCK as the primary offensive move.
3.  **Monitor HP:** Closely monitor Pikachu's HP and prioritize healing when it falls below a safe threshold (potentially >50%).
4.  **Consider Healing Items:** If HP is consistently low, explore purchasing potions or other healing items.
5. **Handle Poison Status:** Should poison status afflict our Pokemon, seek items or other means of removing it
6.  **Evaluate Team Composition:** Once Pikachu reaches a decent level, consider diversifying training with other Pokémon in the party (if applicable).
7. **Re-evaluate GROWL Use:** Avoid using GROWL unless there's a specific tactical reason, as it hinders the primary goal of leveling up through offensive moves.
