# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 27, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Stuck in battle with a fainted Caterpie.
*   **Party:** Pikachu (HP: 14/20).
*   **Objective Status:** Significantly delayed due to a persistent game bug. Pikachu is in need of healing.

## Recent Actions (Turns 60-69)

*   Repeatedly attempted to exit a battle against a wild Caterpie after it fainted.
*   In each turn, the game state remained stuck on the move selection screen, despite the opponent being defeated.
*   The chosen action for each turn was to press "A" in an attempt to advance the dialogue and exit the battle, but this action has not been successful.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Encountered a persistent game-breaking bug:** The game is failing to properly exit battle after an opponent faints, resulting in a loop.
*   **Pikachu's low health:** Pikachu is at 14/20 HP. This situation makes it even more urgent to resolve the bug and heal.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Unforeseen game bug:** The looping battle state is a major obstacle, preventing any further progress.
*   **Stalled Leveling:** Unable to effectively find and win battles to level up pikachu.
*   **Pikachu's decreasing health:** Continuously being in battle is wearing down Pikachu and healing is not an option until out of battle.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Attempt to resolve the bug:** Continue pressing "A" to see if the game can be forced to proceed to the next state. If this doesn't work, consider other input methods or resets (if available within the current environment).
2.  **Prioritize healing:** As soon as the battle bug is resolved, immediately heal Pikachu, preferably at a Pokémon Center.
3.  **Re-evaluate Leveling Strategy:** Once out of the stuck battle, we need to re-assess the effectiveness of the chosen leveling area and Pokemon to battle. If the current area is prone to causing further issues, look into alternative spots to level-up.

## Notes

The current bug is severely impacting progress. Addressing it is the absolute priority. If simple inputs do not solve it, more drastic measures may be necessary (e.g. resetting if possible). We cannot progress towards our primary goal (leveling Pikachu) until this issue is resolved.
