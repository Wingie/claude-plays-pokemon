# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 90-99

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

Our Pidgey consistently faints in battle. Our Charmander is currently our strongest Pokémon and remains at full health (29/29 HP). We are repeatedly prompted to choose a Pokémon after Pidgey faints.

## Recent Actions

*   We have consistently selected Charmander to replace the fainted Pidgey in battle. The primary action across all turns has been choosing Charmander from the "Choose a POKéMON" screen.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Pidgey is weak:** Pidgey consistently faints in the early stages of battle.
*   **Charmander is durable:** Charmander maintains full health despite repeated deployment.
*   **Battle System Observation:** We are gaining familiarity with the Pokémon selection process after a Pokémon faints.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Pidgey's Weakness:** Pidgey's inability to withstand attacks significantly hinders our progress. The constant need to switch to Charmander suggests a need for stronger or more diverse Pokémon.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Training Charmander:** Focus on using Charmander to gain experience and level up.
2.  **Evaluate Pidgey:** Determine if Pidgey can be trained effectively or if catching a new Pokémon is necessary. Consider its stats and learnable moves.
3.  **Seek Out Battles:** Actively search for battles to continue learning the game mechanics and improve our Pokémon's stats.
4.  **Explore Item Usage:** Investigate available items (potions, status healers, etc.) to potentially keep Pidgey in the fight longer or heal Charmander after battles.
