# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 90-99

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

We are currently struggling in battles, consistently losing our Pidgey.  Our Charmander is healthy and ready to fight but hasn't been engaged yet. We are repeatedly being presented with the "Choose a POKéMON" screen.

## Recent Actions

*   For the last ten turns, our primary action has been repeatedly selecting Charmander as the next Pokémon to send out after Pidgey faints.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Pidgey is ineffective:** Pidgey is consistently fainting, suggesting it's under-leveled or poorly matched against current opponents.
*   **Charmander Untested:** Charmander is consistently selected but, based on the provided information, has not participated in any actual combat.
*   **Limited Strategic Variety:** We are consistently resorting to the same action (sending out Charmander) without exploring alternative strategies.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Consistent Defeats:** Pidgey's consistent fainting indicates a lack of viable battle strategy.
*   **Inaction:** Despite selecting Charmander repeatedly, there's no indication of any action occurring after the selection. This could indicate a misunderstanding of the game mechanics.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Engage Charmander:** After selecting Charmander, the next step is to select a move to attack. We must focus on understanding the battle interface and selecting appropriate moves for Charmander.
2.  **Evaluate Charmander's Effectiveness:** Once Charmander is engaged in battle, we need to evaluate its effectiveness against the current opponents. Is Charmander dealing enough damage? Is it taking too much damage?
3.  **Consider Alternative Strategies:** If Charmander is also struggling, we need to explore alternative strategies. This might involve:
    *   **Leveling up:** Seek out easier battles (if any exist) to level up Pidgey or Charmander.
    *   **Catching new Pokémon:** Expand our team with potentially stronger Pokémon.
    *   **Using items:** Learn about and utilize healing items to keep our Pokémon in fighting condition.
4.  **Learn Type Matchups:** Research the basic type matchups (Fire beats Grass, etc.) to make more informed decisions during battle.
