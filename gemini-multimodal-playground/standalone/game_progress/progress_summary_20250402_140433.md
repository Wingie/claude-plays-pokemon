# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest
*   **Lead Pokémon HP:** 22/29 (Needs Healing)
*   **Objective Status:**  Stuck in Viridian Forest, attempting to navigate to Viridian City to heal. No Pikachu encountered yet.

## Recent Actions (Turns 44-54)

The past 10 turns can be summarized into three primary phases:

1.  **Post-Battle Cleanup (Turns 44-47):**  The initial turns were spent clearing the battle summary screen after a fight against a Pidgey. This involved repeatedly pressing the `A` button to dismiss the summary.

2.  **Attempting to Escape and Heal (Turns 48-54):** Realizing our lead Pokémon needs healing, the focus shifted to escaping Viridian Forest and reaching the Pokémon Center in Viridian City.  Due to the lack of a map, the current strategy involves a heuristic approach, assuming a general direction to reach the exit. Several attempts were made to move out of the forest.

    *   **Initial Attempt:** Moving left repeatedly (Turns 48-49), aiming for Viridian City.
    *   **Second Attempt:** Tried moving down 3 times, followed by left (Turn 50, 52).
    *   **Resumed Attempt:** Continued moving left repeatedly (Turns 53-54), after apparently re-entering tall grass.

## Key Discoveries and Challenges

*   **Stuck in Viridian Forest:**  The player is struggling to navigate the forest effectively due to the lack of a map and reliable directional cues.
*   **Ineffective Navigation Strategy:** Blindly moving in a single direction isn't proving successful.  The agent is getting stuck or re-entering areas already explored.
*   **Healing is Paramount:** The low HP of the lead Pokémon is a major constraint, limiting exploration due to the risk of further battles.
*   **No Pikachu Encountered:** Despite the primary goal, no Pikachu has been found so far. This may be due to the focus on escaping/healing rather than focused exploration.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Prioritize Healing:** The immediate priority remains escaping Viridian Forest and reaching the Pokémon Center in Viridian City.
2.  **Refine Navigation Strategy:** The current "move left/down" strategy is not effective. We need a more robust approach to explore the environment. This might involve:
    *   Implementing a more intelligent movement pattern (e.g., exploring edges, remembering visited tiles).
    *   Considering if there's a general direction that has not been explored.
3.  **Explore for Pikachu After Healing:** Once the Pokémon are healed, resume exploring Viridian Forest with a focus on encountering and catching a Pikachu.
