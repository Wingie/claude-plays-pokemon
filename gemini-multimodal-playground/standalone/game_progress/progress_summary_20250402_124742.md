# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

We have successfully healed our Pokémon at the Viridian City Pokémon Center and are now located on Route 1. We are actively seeking out battles with wild Pokémon to gain experience and improve our fighting skills. We are currently engaged in a battle with a wild Rattata.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 20-22:** Healed Pokémon at the Viridian City Pokémon Center by advancing through dialogue with the nurse.
*   **Turn 23:** Exited the Pokémon Center and began exploring Viridian City. Then transitioned to Route 1 to find battles.
*   **Turns 24-29:** Initiated a battle with a wild Rattata and have repeatedly selected the first attack option in an attempt to defeat it.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Viridian City Pokémon Center:** Provides a location to heal our Pokémon.
*   **Route 1:** Contains wild Pokémon, specifically Rattata, suitable for gaining battle experience.
*   **Attack Reliability:** We have identified an issue where attacks do not always land. Pidgey's attack missed in the most recent turn.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Inaccurate Attacks:** Our Pokémon's attacks can miss, prolonging battles and potentially leading to losses.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Win the current battle with the Rattata.** Continue using the first attack option until victorious.
2.  **Continue battling wild Pokémon on Route 1.** Focus on gaining experience and improving our fighting skills.
3.  **Explore Route 1 further.** Look for different types of Pokémon and opportunities to train our team.
4.  **Develop a better understanding of battle mechanics.** Analyze why attacks miss and consider alternative strategies or moves.
