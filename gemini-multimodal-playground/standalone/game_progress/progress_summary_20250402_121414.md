# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, near tall grass, position (0,8).
*   **Party:** Currently switching from Mankey (5/15 HP) to Charmander in battle.
*   **Objective:** Level up Mankey.

## Recent Actions (Turns 10-19)

*   **Exploration:** Initially attempted to move upwards, but was blocked by trees. Maneuvered to the right.
*   **Battles:** Engaged in a series of battles exclusively against wild Pidgey.
*   **Combat Strategy:** Repeatedly used Mankey's first attack option (presumably "Scratch").
*   **Emergency Switch:** Due to Mankey's low health (5/15 HP), made the decision to switch out Mankey for Charmander.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Terrain Obstacles:**  The initial path northward is blocked by trees, requiring alternative routes.
*   **Enemy Encounter Rate:** Pidgey appears to be a very common wild Pokémon in the current area.
*   **Sustained Damage:** Repeated battles, even against seemingly weak opponents like Pidgey, are draining Mankey's HP significantly.
*   **Tactical Limitations:** Solely relying on the first attack is unsustainable and dangerous to Mankey's health.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Navigation:**  Limited mobility due to terrain.
*   **Low-Level Grind:**  Battling weak opponents is proving slow and inefficient, and risks depleting Mankey's health.
*   **Mankey's Vulnerability:**  Mankey's low HP necessitates strategic considerations beyond simply attacking.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Heal Mankey:**  Prioritize healing Mankey's HP to avoid fainting and potential setbacks.
2.  **Explore Route Options:** Find a more efficient route, potentially one with weaker wild Pokémon or the possibility of quickly reaching a Pokemon Center.
3.  **Strategic Battle Assessment:** Evaluate alternative battle strategies for Mankey, including potentially using other available moves or prioritizing defensive maneuvers when low on health.
4.  **Charmander's Training:** Given the need to switch to Charmander, we should consider gaining some experience with it.
