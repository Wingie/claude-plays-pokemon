# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore the area, catch a Mankey, Pikachu, and Pidgey.

## I. Current Status

The player is currently outside a Pokémon Center, likely in a new area after initially being near the Mart. The player is now in a grassy area and ready to explore.

## II. Recent Actions

*   **Initial Confusion:** The player repeatedly remained in front of the Mart, seemingly stuck in a loop, trying to enter without success.
*   **Stuck in a Shop:** After a transition to Route 22, the player became trapped inside a shop/building. Several turns were spent attempting to exit the shop, trying various directions without success.
*   **Successful Exit:** Finally, the player was able to exit the shop/building, likely by moving down (based on the description of a red mat near the exit).
*   **Exploration Begins:** Having exited the building, the player is now near a Pokémon Center and has begun to move down into a grassy area to start exploring.

## III. Key Discoveries

*   **Location Transition:** The player transitioned from being near the Mart to Route 22.
*   **Navigation Challenges:** The player experienced difficulty with basic navigation, first failing to enter the Mart and then becoming stuck inside a building on Route 22. This highlights potential control or perspective issues.
*   **Environmental Clues:** The player identified the red mat on the floor as a clue to the shop's exit, demonstrating observation skills.
*   **Pokémon Center Proximity:** The player is now near a Pokémon Center, providing a safe haven to heal their Pokémon when needed.

## IV. Next Objectives

1.  **Explore the Grassy Area:** Systematically explore the grassy area and Route 22, searching for Mankey, Pikachu, and Pidgey.
2.  **Engage with Wild Pokémon:** Engage in battles with wild Pokémon to level up the starter Pokémon and potentially catch new Pokémon.
3.  **Heal at Pokémon Center:** Utilize the nearby Pokémon Center to heal the Pokémon's HP and PP after battles.
4.  **Re-evaluate Navigation:** Pay close attention to the controls and environment to avoid getting stuck in buildings or confused about locations.
5.  **Optimize Catching Strategy:** Develop and refine a strategy for catching desired Pokémon (Mankey, Pikachu, Pidgey) including the use of items like Poké Balls.
