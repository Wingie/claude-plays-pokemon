# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

## Current Status

*   **Primary Goal:** Train Mankey.
*   **Location:** (Assuming we are in an early route with common Rattata spawns) Early Route (likely Route 1 or Route 2).
*   **Party:** Mankey (level and moveset unknown, but assumed to have Scratch).

## Recent Actions (Turns 45-54)

*   Exited the Poke Ball menu twice without using any items (Turns 45-46).
*   Engaged in a series of battles against wild Rattata (Turns 47-54).
*   Consistently used the first attack option, assumed to be "Scratch," during battles (Turns 47-54).

## Key Discoveries/Observations

*   **Rattata Abundance:**  Wild Rattata are a very common encounter in our current location.
*   **Menu Navigation:** We are successfully exiting menus using the "B" button.
*   **Attack Selection:** We are consistently selecting the first attack option, presumably "Scratch."

## Challenges

*   **Monotony:** Battling the same Pokémon repeatedly (Rattata) can be slow and potentially lead to insufficient experience gains.
*   **Lack of Variety:** Relying solely on "Scratch" may become problematic against Pokémon with higher Defense or different typings.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Grinding Mankey:** Continue battling wild Pokémon, primarily Rattata for now, to increase Mankey's level.
2.  **Observe Level Ups:** Pay close attention to Mankey's level-ups to learn new moves. A new move could drastically improve our combat effectiveness.
3.  **Explore Beyond Rattata:** Consider moving to a different area if Rattata battles become too inefficient. We should look for routes that offer a wider variety of Pokémon or Pokémon that give more experience.
4.  **Monitor Mankey's Stats:** Track Mankey's stats to understand its strengths and weaknesses, informing future training decisions and team composition.
