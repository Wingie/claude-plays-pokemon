# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Exploration

**Current Status:**

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest, Coordinates (7, 5)
*   **State:** Engaged in a battle with a Weedle. Currently stuck in a dialog state within the battle.
*   **Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.
*   **Lead Pokémon Health:** Unknown (Needs to be monitored once battle menu is accessible)
*   **Healing Needed:** No (Currently), needs evaluation after the battle
*   **Exploration:** Viridian Forest exploration initiated, no specific areas marked as explored yet.

**Recent Actions & Analysis:**

The initial turns focused on exploring Viridian Forest, primarily by moving "up" into the tall grass to trigger wild Pokémon encounters. We successfully entered a battle, but are currently stuck in a dialog state. Repeated actions of "pressing A" are now necessary to advance past the dialog and reach the battle menu where moves can be selected.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Confirmed location within Viridian Forest.
*   Encountered a wild Weedle, initiating a battle.
*   Identified an issue: Dialog boxes stalling progress during battles.

**Obstacles Faced:**

*   **Dialog Stalling:** The primary obstacle is being stuck in a dialog loop at the start of the battle. This prevents selecting moves and progressing the battle.
*   **Unknown Pokémon Health:** We need to be aware of the health of our lead Pokémon during and after each battle to minimize the risk of fainting.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Advance Past Dialog:** Continue pressing 'A' to clear the dialog and access the battle menu.
2.  **Battle Strategy:** Once the battle menu is accessible, evaluate available moves and select the most effective one to defeat Weedle.
3.  **Monitor Health:** Closely monitor the lead Pokémon's health during the battle.
4.  **Post-Battle Assessment:** After the battle, assess the lead Pokémon's health. If low, explore options for healing.
5.  **Resume Exploration:** After the battle and any necessary healing, continue moving up in Viridian Forest to encounter and battle more Pokémon.
6.  **Record Coords:** Start recording explored coordinates to avoid unnecessary repetition

**Longer-Term Strategy Adjustments:**

*   **Prioritize Battle Mechanics Understanding:** Dedicate time to understanding the battle mechanics and optimal move choices.
*   **Resource Management:** Be mindful of health resources and when healing is necessary.
*   **Map Awareness:** While coordinate tracking is not perfect, attempt to build a mental or physical map of explored areas to optimize pathing and avoid backtracking.
