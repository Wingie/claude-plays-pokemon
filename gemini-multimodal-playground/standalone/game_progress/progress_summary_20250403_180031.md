# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest
*   **Party:** Pidgey (Level Up Complete - Full Health)
*   **Progress:** Exploring the forest. Recent turns primarily involved battling Kakuna. We have escaped from a previous battle loop and are now in the overworld at coordinates (4, 7).
*   **Status Effects:** None

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 10-19)

*   **Turns 10-18:** Repeatedly encountered Kakuna in battle. Due to a lack of information on available moves, the strategy was to select the first available move (pressing 'A'). This resulted in a battle loop, where we continued to encounter and battle Kakuna. We also did not get accurate coordinate detection for the majority of these turns
*   **Turn 19:** Successfully detected the overworld and current coordinates at (4, 7), indicating an escape from the battle loop. Pidgey leveled up and restored to full health.

## III. Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Viridian Forest Encounters:** Kakuna is a common encounter in Viridian Forest.
*   **Battle Loop:** Without proper information on moves and type advantages, we are vulnerable to getting stuck in battle loops, particularly with common, weaker Pokémon.
*   **Coordinate Tracking Issues:** There were significant issues tracking coordinates, indicating a reliance on visual cues might be necessary if coordinate detection is unreliable.
*   **Pidgey Leveled Up:** Gained a level with Pidgey.

## IV. Challenges Faced

*   **Battle Loop:** The primary challenge has been escaping the battle loop with Kakuna. Selecting a move randomly doesn't guarantee a swift victory and can lead to repetitive battles.
*   **Lack of Information:** Lack of knowledge about available moves, type advantages, and enemy weaknesses hinders efficient battling.
*   **Coordinate Detection:** Inaccurate coordinate detection made it difficult to determine our location and strategize movement in the overworld.

## V. Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Exploring Viridian Forest:** Resume searching for Pikachu.
2.  **Prioritize Avoiding Kakuna:** To avoid getting stuck in another loop, try to flee from encounters with Kakuna if possible.
3.  **Gather Move Information:** Find a way to determine the available moves for our Pokémon and identify their type advantages. If available, prioritize using moves that are effective against common Viridian Forest Pokémon (like Bug and Poison types).
4.  **Refine Coordinate Tracking:** Investigate better methods for detecting the overworld screen state and coordinates. Supplement coordinate-based navigation with visual landmark recognition if necessary.
5.  **Maximize Tall Grass Encounters:** Move through tall grass to increase the chances of encountering new Pokémon, including Pikachu. Consider alternating movement patterns to cover more ground.

## VI. Strategies to Implement

*   **Aggressive Fleeing:** If faced with Kakuna battles, attempt to flee immediately.
*   **Learn Move Sets:** Prioritize identifying move types and strengths for our Pokémon.
*   **Type Advantage Research:** Study type matchups to optimize move selection in battles.
*   **Patterned Exploration:** Adopt a structured movement pattern (e.g., systematically traversing north to south, east to west) in the tall grass to ensure thorough exploration.

## VII. Notes
- Need to remember to use a pokeball to catch pikachu!
