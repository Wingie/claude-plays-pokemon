# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 10-19

**Current Goal:** Explore the area and catch a Mankey, Pikachu, and Pidgey.

## Current Status

*   **Engaged in Battle:** Currently battling a Mankey.
*   **Catch Attempt in Progress:** Multiple Poké Ball attempts have been made on the Mankey.
*   **Item Selection Learning Curve:** Still navigating the item selection menu within battles.

## Recent Actions

*   **Engaged Mankey:** Initiated a battle with a Mankey with the intent to catch it.
*   **Weakening Strategy:** Used 'Scratch' attack to weaken the Mankey. Several critical hits landed, suggesting potential over-weakening.
*   **Poké Ball Attempts:** Threw multiple Poké Balls at the Mankey, but the capture was unsuccessful.
*   **Menu Navigation:** Learning the in-battle menu navigation for item selection, specifically the Poké Ball.
*   **Observed Mankey Behavior:** Mankey used 'Leer', lowering Charmander's defense.

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Critical Hits:** The 'Scratch' attack resulted in multiple critical hits, potentially weakening the Mankey too much before attempting to catch it. This highlights the need for more precise damage control.
*   **In-Battle Item Selection:** Item selection in battle isn't immediately intuitive; requires menu navigation.
*   **Mankey's Moveset:** Observed that Mankey knows the move 'Leer', which reduces defense.
*   **Catch Rate Challenge:** The catch rate for Mankey appears to be lower than anticipated, requiring multiple Poké Ball throws.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Catch Mankey:** Continue attempting to catch the Mankey, adjusting strategy based on the learned insights. Consider these tactics:
    *   **Alternate Attacks:** If available, use weaker attacks (e.g., Growl, Ember with low PP) to avoid critical hits and over-weakening.
    *   **Status Conditions:** Consider using moves to inflict status conditions like paralysis or sleep (if available later) to increase catch rate.
    *   **Poké Ball Optimization:** Explore using Great Balls if Mankey proves difficult to catch with regular Poké Balls (requires obtaining Great Balls first).
2.  **Master Item Selection:** Familiarize with the in-battle item selection process for smoother item usage.
3.  **Resource Management:** Keep track of the number of Poké Balls remaining and replenish as needed.
4.  **Continue Exploration:** Once Mankey is caught (or the attempt is abandoned), continue exploring the surrounding area to find Pikachu and Pidgey.
