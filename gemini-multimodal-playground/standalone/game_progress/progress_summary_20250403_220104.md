# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon in Viridian Forest

## Current Status

*   Currently located in Viridian Forest.
*   Character coordinates: (7, 5).
*   About to engage in a battle with BUG CATCHER RICK.
*   `is_in_battle = TRUE` (inferred).

## Recent Actions (Turns 25-34)

*   **Initial Strategy (Failed):** Repeatedly attempting to move "Up" at coordinates (8,5) resulted in a loop, unable to progress.  The bot identified the need to change direction.
*   **Revised Strategy:** The bot attempted to move "Right" to reach tall grass and trigger wild Pokémon encounters for leveling.
*   **Interruption:**  Encountered an NPC ("Hey! You have POKÉMON! Come"). Dialogue needed to be advanced using the "A" button.
*   **Forced Battle:** Encountered and triggered a battle with BUG CATCHER RICK. The bot now knows a battle will occur.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Movement Loop:** Identified and addressed a movement loop by changing direction.
*   **Dialogue Handling:** The bot now recognizes and acts upon dialogue sequences, using the "A" button to advance.
*   **NPC Interaction:** Demonstrated the ability to understand and react to NPC interactions.
*   **Battle Initiation:** Recognized and is now initiating battle sequences.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Initiate Battle:** Press "A" to start the battle with BUG CATCHER RICK.
2.  **Engage in Battle:** Develop a battle strategy to defeat BUG CATCHER RICK's WEEDLE (and subsequent Pokémon, if any).  The specifics of the battle sequence and move selection are not yet defined in these turns, so this needs to be addressed.
3.  **Post-Battle:** Once the battle is complete, re-evaluate leveling strategy and resume exploration of Viridian Forest.
4.  **Refine Movement Strategy:** Implement a more robust movement strategy to avoid loops and efficiently traverse the environment. Potentially incorporate mapping to remember previously explored areas.
