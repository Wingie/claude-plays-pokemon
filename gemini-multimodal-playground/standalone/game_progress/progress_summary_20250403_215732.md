# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon (primarily Pikachu).

## Current Status

*   **Location:** In battle.
*   **Active Pokémon:** Pikachu
*   **Pikachu HP:** 14/20
*   **Opponent:** Rattata

## Recent Actions (Turns 55-64)

*   Repeatedly used Thunder Shock against a Rattata.
*   Continually pressed 'A' to advance the battle dialog after each Thunder Shock.
*   Encountered some difficulties with advancing the dialog.

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Battle Strategy:** The primary (and potentially only) strategy employed currently is using Thunder Shock with Pikachu.
*   **Bottleneck:** A significant amount of time is spent advancing dialog after each attack. This process seems inefficient and is slowing down the leveling process.
*   **Pikachu's HP:** Pikachu is taking damage but surviving the current battles against Rattata.
*   **Stuck in Dialog:** The biggest problem is that the bot appears to be stuck on advancing the dialog and doesn't recognize the battle is over.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Repetitive Actions:** The gameplay is currently stuck in a loop of attacking and advancing dialog.
*   **Dialog Advance Issue:** The consistent need to advance dialog is slowing down progress and indicates a potential issue with dialog recognition or automation.
*   **Low Pikachu HP:** Constant battles without healing could lead to Pikachu fainting, further hindering progress.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Troubleshoot Dialog Issue:** Identify and resolve the reason for the excessive number of 'A' button presses needed to advance the dialog and resume control. Investigate why the script doesn't recognize when the battle is complete.
2.  **Evaluate Battle Effectiveness:** Determine the effectiveness of Thunder Shock against the current opponent (Rattata).
3.  **Monitor Pikachu's HP:** Closely monitor Pikachu's HP and implement a strategy to heal when necessary. Potentially use items or return to a Pokémon Center.
4.  **Implement Battle Completion Detection:** Ensure the script correctly identifies when a battle is over and moves on to the next step in the overall strategy (e.g., finding another opponent).
5. **Explore Leveling Locations:** If the current leveling spot (against Rattata) proves inefficient, find a new location to train.
