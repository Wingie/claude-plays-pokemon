# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Current Goal:** Level up Pikachu through battles

## Current Status

*   **In Battle:** Currently engaged in a battle against a wild Caterpie.
*   **Battle Menu:** The battle menu ("FIGHT", "BAG", "POKEMON", "RUN") is currently *not* visible. We are still in the initial dialogue sequence of the battle.
*   **Focus:** Pikachu needs to gain experience to level up.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 10-19:** Repeatedly encountered a wild Caterpie and attempted to advance the initial battle dialogue by pressing the "A" button. The objective has been to move past the initial screen and access the battle menu.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Caterpie is Prevalent:** The area we are in seems to have a high encounter rate for Caterpie. This could be a good or bad thing depending on its EXP yield.
*   **Dialogue Bottleneck:** The game requires multiple "A" button presses to advance past the initial battle dialogue before the battle menu becomes accessible.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Repetitive Actions:** The game's initial dialogue sequence is slowing down progress, requiring multiple inputs before we can actually initiate an attack.
*   **Lack of Menu Access:** Inability to access the battle menu prevents us from selecting a move and actively battling.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Advance Dialogue:** Continue pressing "A" until the battle menu appears ("FIGHT", "BAG", "POKEMON", "RUN").
2.  **Select "FIGHT":** Once the battle menu is accessible, navigate to and select the "FIGHT" option.
3.  **Choose a Move:** Select an appropriate attack for Pikachu to use against Caterpie, prioritizing moves with type advantage or high damage output (given Pikachu's move set).
4.  **Monitor EXP Gain:** After defeating Caterpie, observe the experience gained by Pikachu to determine if this is an efficient method for leveling.
5.  **Re-evaluate Location (if needed):** If Caterpie yields insufficient EXP, explore alternative locations with potentially stronger Pokémon for more efficient leveling.
