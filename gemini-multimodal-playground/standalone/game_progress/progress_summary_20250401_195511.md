# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** Current
**Game:** Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen

## Current Status

We are currently in Pallet Town, standing near the town sign. Our ultimate goal is to reach Viridian City, which lies to the north. While we know Viridian City is north of Pallet Town, a fence initially blocked a direct path.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 90-92:** We began exploring an unknown area, moving north until a sign became visible.
*   **Turns 93-94:** The sign was examined, revealing our location: Pallet Town.
*   **Turns 95-99:** Attempts were made to move north and exit Pallet Town, but a fence initially obstructed a direct path. An alternative path has been identified - moving right, then up, then left, to circumvent the fence.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Location Identified:** We have successfully identified our starting location as Pallet Town.
*   **Viridian City Direction:** Viridian City lies to the north of Pallet Town.
*   **Obstacle Encountered:** A fence initially blocked our path directly north.
*   **Path Planning:** We have adjusted our path to navigate the fence.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Navigate the Fence:** Execute the planned route (right, then up, then left) to bypass the fence blocking the path north out of Pallet Town.
2.  **Enter Route 1:** Proceed north onto Route 1 after navigating the fence.
3.  **Reach Viridian City:** Explore Route 1 and continue north towards Viridian City.
4.  **Explore the Pokedex and Map Screen:** Continue to explore the pokedex and map screen.
