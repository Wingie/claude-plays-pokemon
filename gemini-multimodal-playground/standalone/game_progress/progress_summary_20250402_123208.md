# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

Currently exploring the overworld and actively engaging in battles to fulfill the primary objective. We are positioned in an area with tall grass and trees to the right, conducive to encountering wild Pokémon.

## Recent Actions

*   **Exploration:** Continuously moving upwards in the overworld in search of battles.
*   **Battles:** Engaged in a series of battles.
*   **Enemy Encountered:**  Consistently encountered and battling wild Rattata.
*   **Action Pattern:** Consistently choosing to "attack" in battles.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Environment:** Identified an area characterized by tall grass and trees, which are known habitats for wild Pokémon.
*   **Common Enemy:** Rattata appear to be a frequently encountered wild Pokémon in the current area.
*   **Battle Initiation:** Walking in the tall grass triggers wild Pokémon battles.

## Challenges

*   **Repetitive Encounters:**  Currently facing a string of identical battles against Rattata, which may hinder broader learning about different Pokémon types and battle strategies.
*   **Lack of Specificity:** The consistently repeated "attack" command provides no information on specific move usage or strategic thinking. The specific attacks being used are unknown.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Exploration:**  While the current area offers battles, exploring further could reveal different Pokémon and battle scenarios. Consider moving in different directions (left, right, down) to vary encounters.
2.  **Vary Battle Strategy:** Instead of simply attacking, consider using different moves (if available) to learn about their effects and advantages. Consider using items if available and applicable.
3.  **Evaluate Pokémon Team (If Applicable):** If a team exists, assess their strengths and weaknesses based on the battles fought so far. (The current team is unknown)
4.  **Consider Catching (if possible):** Attempt to catch one of the Rattata to broaden the team. (The current team is unknown).

## Insights and Strategies

*   **Area Awareness:** The game world appears to be designed to promote random encounters in areas with tall grass.
*   **Need for Diversification:** While battles are being found, the encounters are repetitive. Finding a way to diversify the opponents will be key to learning.
*   **Battle Logs are Limited:** Without knowing specific move usage or outcomes (damage dealt, status effects), it's difficult to analyze the effectiveness of the current battle strategy.
