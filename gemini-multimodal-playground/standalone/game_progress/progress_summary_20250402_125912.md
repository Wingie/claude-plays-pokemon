# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

The trainer is currently on Route 1, having exited the Viridian City Pokémon Center. The Pokémon team is fully healed. The trainer is actively seeking wild Pokémon encounters to engage in battles. However, there appear to be issues with consistent Pokémon selection during battle.

## Recent Actions (Turns 40-49)

*   **Turns 40-43:** Healed Pokémon team at Viridian City Pokémon Center and exited to the overworld.
*   **Turn 44:** Moved onto Route 1 and entered the tall grass to search for Pokémon.
*   **Turns 45-49:** Initiated a Pokémon battle and encountered issues with the battle sequence and Pokémon selection. Specifically, the trainer seems to be repeatedly attempting to switch Pokémon during a battle, despite having already made a selection.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Route 1:** Identified as a location where wild Pokémon encounters are possible.
*   **Battle Sequence Challenges:** The trainer appears to be struggling with the Pokémon selection and switching mechanics within battles. There is confusion or misinterpretation of the actions required.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Successfully engage in and win a Pokémon battle on Route 1.** This requires resolving the issues with Pokémon selection and understanding battle mechanics.
2.  **Explore Route 1 thoroughly** to encounter different Pokémon and gain experience.
3.  **Improve understanding of Pokémon battle interface:** Reviewing the options (Fight, Switch, Item, Run) and their functionality is crucial.

## Insights & Challenges

*   **Understanding Game Mechanics:** The recent turns highlight a potential misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the Pokémon battle sequence and how to execute desired actions (specifically switching). This is a significant impediment to progress.
*   **Pokémon Selection:** The frequent switching attempts suggest the trainer isn't happy with the current Pokémon selection or doesn't understand the strengths of each Pokémon in the party against the wild encounter.

## Future Plans

*   **Prioritize Understanding Battle Mechanics:** Before advancing further, dedicate time to understanding how to effectively choose attacks, switch Pokémon, use items, and run from battles. Possibly watch a short tutorial video.
*   **Focus on Building a Strong Team:** Once comfortable with battle mechanics, strategize on leveling up Pokémon and catching diverse types to handle various enemy matchups.
