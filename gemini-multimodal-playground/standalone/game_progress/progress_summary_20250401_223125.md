**Current Goal:** head north and find the pokemart with blue roof in viridian city

# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Locate the blue-roofed Pokémart in Viridian City.

**Current Status:** Navigating around an obstacle (ledge and NPC) preventing northward progress towards Viridian City. Moving westward to circumvent the blockage.

## Recent Actions (Turns 13-30)

*   **Initial Movement:** Repeatedly attempted to move north, seemingly encountering frequent wild Rattata encounters. Charmander gained 32 EXP, indicating a battle victory.
*   **Obstacle Encountered:** Discovered a ledge at (6, 11) blocking the direct northward path. An NPC is also obstructing the path.
*   **Course Correction:** Initiated a westward movement to bypass the ledge and NPC. Continued pressing left to move further west.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Ledge Navigation:** The map design requires maneuvering around ledges to progress.
*   **Obstacle Priority:** Identified a ledge and NPC as immediate obstacles.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Complete Westward Movement:** Continue moving left until the ledge is circumvented.
2.  **Adjust Path North:** Once clear of the ledge, begin moving north again towards Viridian City.
3.  **Locate Pokémart:** Upon reaching Viridian City, identify the Pokémart with the blue roof.

## Strategic Analysis

*   **Inefficient Initial Approach:** Repeatedly pressing 'up' was ineffective due to the ledge. This demonstrates the need for careful observation of the environment.
*   **Adaptive Problem-Solving:** Correctly identified the need to move left to bypass the obstacle and initiate that course of action.

## Future Considerations

*   **Encounter Management:** The frequency of wild Rattata encounters might necessitate acquiring Poké Balls or adjusting movement strategy.
*   **NPC Interaction:** Be prepared to interact with the NPC, potentially requiring a battle or dialogue.
