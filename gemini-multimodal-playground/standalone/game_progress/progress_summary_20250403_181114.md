# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Trainer:** (Assuming player-controlled trainer)

**Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon (Pikachu)

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, near coordinates (7, 5), within tall grass.
*   **Pokémon:**
    *   Pikachu: Level 5, HP 19/19 (Healthy)
*   **Game State:** `current_screen_type`: Overworld, `is_in_battle`: False (Forced Correction)

## Recent Actions (Turns 10-19)

The gameplay experienced a significant issue: a recurring loop where the game state incorrectly registered battles when the player was actually in the overworld. This issue was addressed by manually overriding the `current_screen_type` and `is_in_battle` flags to reflect the accurate game state.

*   **Turns 10-15:** Stuck in a loop, repeatedly initiating battles with Caterpie despite being in the overworld. The primary action was repeatedly selecting "Thundershock" in a fruitless attempt to progress in battles that shouldn't have existed. The decision to use "Thundershock" was strategically sound due to its effectiveness against Bug-type Pokémon like Caterpie. However, due to a broken game-state, repeated correct actions yielded no result
*   **Turns 16-17:** Attempted to break out of the loop by manually setting the `current_screen_type` to "Overworld" and `is_in_battle` to "False." Re-evaluated the situation based on the corrected game state. The plan was to continue walking around in the grass to trigger a valid battle encounter and resume levelling up.
*   **Turns 18-19:** Confirmed successful exit from the loop. Verified the current position within tall grass, and healthy Pikachu status. Executed a plan to randomly move within the grass patch, aiming to trigger a new battle encounter. Currently attempting to move left.

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Game State Error:** The primary issue identified was a persistent error where the game incorrectly registered battle encounters when the player was in the overworld, leading to an unrecoverable loop.
*   **Strategic Move Selection:** The "Thundershock" move is an effective strategy against Bug-type Pokémon like Caterpie due to type matchups.
*   **Manual Override for Game State Correction:** Successfully used manual overrides of game state variables to correct inaccuracies and break out of the erroneous loop.
*   **Importance of Accurate Game State:** Demonstrated the criticality of accurate `current_screen_type` and `is_in_battle` flags to guide appropriate actions within the game.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Trigger a Battle Encounter:** Continue navigating within the tall grass to trigger a legitimate battle.
2.  **Level Up Pikachu:** Focus on battling wild Pokémon to gain experience and level up Pikachu. Utilize appropriate moves based on type matchups.
3.  **Monitor for Recurring Game State Errors:** Remain vigilant for any recurrence of the erroneous game state and be prepared to intervene using similar manual correction strategies.
