# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Engaged in a battle against a Rattata. Charmander is level 9 with 18/27 HP.
*   Objective remains: Find the blue-roofed Poké Mart in Viridian City.

**Recent Actions (Turns 90-99):**

*   We have been repeatedly navigating menus during a battle against a Rattata.
*   Considerable difficulty has been experienced exiting the Pokémon info and selection screens. The player keeps accidentally accessing these screens instead of directly selecting "FIGHT".
*   Eventually, after multiple attempts, the battle has resumed from turn 99.
*   Selected "FIGHT" and are ready to attack with Charmander.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Navigating menus within the battle system can be cumbersome and prone to errors, leading to wasted turns.
*   The game's interface sometimes defaults to unexpected screens (Pokémon info or selection), interrupting the intended action.
*   Directly selecting "FIGHT" can be less intuitive than expected.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  Successfully execute an attack against the Rattata.
2.  Win the battle.
3.  Heal Charmander if necessary after the battle.
4.  Continue heading north towards Viridian City.
5.  Locate the Poké Mart with a blue roof in Viridian City.

**Strategic Considerations:**

*   **Menu Navigation:** Pay closer attention to the selected option before pressing 'A'. Practice navigating the in-battle menus smoothly to avoid accidental screen selections.
*   **Strategic Planning:** Before each turn, clearly define the intended action (e.g., FIGHT, RUN, ITEM) to minimize errors.
*   **Healing:** After battles, prioritize healing Charmander at the Pokémon Center if necessary to prevent future faints.
