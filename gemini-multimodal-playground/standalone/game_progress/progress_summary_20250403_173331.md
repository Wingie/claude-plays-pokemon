# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Engaged in a battle in Viridian Forest.
*   **Environment:** Tall grass
*   **Battle Status:** Currently battling a Weedle.
*   **Party Health:** Assumed to be at full health.
*   **Pikachu Status:** Not yet encountered.

## Recent Actions & Progress

Our initial turns were focused on navigating from an unknown starting location, eventually identified as likely being the Viridian City Pokémon Center (PC), to Viridian Forest. This involved exiting the PC by moving downwards. Once outside the PC, movement towards the grassy area was pursued.

After entering the tall grass, we began randomly moving to trigger encounters. A battle was initiated with a Weedle. Since encountering the Weedle, all turns have been spent repeatedly selecting the "Fight" option and using the first move, assumed to be Tackle, to continue the battle.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Viridian City PC Location:** The initial location was pinpointed as the Viridian City PC based on map coordinates and interior features.
*   **Viridian Forest Entry:** Successfully navigated from the PC to the tall grass of Viridian Forest.
*   **Wild Pokémon Encounters:** Encounters are initiated in tall grass, as expected.
*   **Weedle Encounter:** We have encountered multiple Weedle battles.
## Challenges Faced

*   **Initial Navigation:** Difficulty in identifying the starting location and navigating out of the Viridian City PC.
*   **Repetitive Weedle Encounters:** While battling is necessary, the consistent encounter with Weedle is not progressing the primary objective of finding a Pikachu.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Battle:** Defeat the current Weedle in battle.
2.  **Post-Battle Strategy:** After the battle, implement a new strategy.
3.  **Pikachu Priority:** After gaining some experience, prioritize Pikachu encounters over battling every Pokémon. Consider exploring different areas within Viridian Forest to increase the likelihood of finding a Pikachu.
4.  **Monitor Party Health:** Pay attention to the party's health and return to the Pokémon Center if needed.
