# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** Current Date

**Current Goal:** Find and win battles to learn how to fight.

## I. Current Status

The player is currently located in tall grass at position (6, 11) in the overworld. The immediate surroundings consist primarily of tall grass, with trees bordering the east. The player has recently won a battle against a wild Pidgey and gained 23 experience points. The player is actively seeking out additional battles to further their learning and training.

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 90-99)

The primary focus of the recent turns has been on engaging in and winning battles to gain experience and learn combat mechanics. The player has followed this pattern:

1.  **Engage in Battle:** The player has consistently used the first available attack option ("Tackle" in at least one confirmed instance), assumed to be the strongest.
2.  **Defeat Wild Pokémon:** Successfully defeated at least one wild Pidgey.
3.  **Return to Overworld:** Pressed 'A' to advance through post-battle dialogue and return to the overworld.
4.  **Seek New Battles:** Moved in the tall grass to trigger new encounters. The player appears to be moving towards the left to find more battles.
5.  **Repeat:** Repeated the cycle of finding battles, selecting attacks, and navigating the overworld.

## III. Key Discoveries & Observations

*   **Battle Trigger:** Tall grass reliably spawns wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Attack Selection:** The first attack option in the FIGHT menu is being used as the assumed "strongest" move.
*   **Post-Battle Sequence:** Pressing 'A' is required to advance the text and return to the overworld after a battle.
*   **Experience Points:** Gained 23 EXP points from defeating a Pidgey.
*   **Position Tracking:** The player is aware of and tracking their position in the overworld.
*   **Resource Constraint:** No resource constraints (Potions, Poké Balls) are apparent yet.

## IV. Challenges Faced

*   **Limited Strategic Depth:** The player is currently relying on a very basic strategy – using the first available attack. This approach may become less effective as the game progresses and enemy Pokémon become stronger or possess type advantages.
*   **Repetitive Gameplay:** The loop of seeking, battling, and returning to the overworld may become monotonous.

## V. Next Objectives & Planned Actions

1.  **Continue Seeking Battles:** Maintain the current strategy of moving through tall grass to find more wild Pokémon to battle.
2.  **Evaluate Battle Strategy:** Reassess the effectiveness of using the first attack option. Consider exploring other moves or switching Pokémon if available.
3.  **Explore Surrounding Area:** While the immediate goal is to find battles, begin to explore the surrounding area to potentially discover new locations, items, or non-player characters (NPCs).
4. **Avoid Looping:** If possible, continue moving in a consistent direction (currently left) to avoid getting stuck in a repetitive loop within the same patch of tall grass.

## VI. Long-Term Considerations

*   **Pokémon Types:** Start learning about Pokémon types and type matchups to improve battle effectiveness.
*   **Item Usage:** Learn how to use items like Potions to heal Pokémon and Poké Balls to catch new Pokémon.
*   **Team Composition:** Consider the benefits of having a diverse team of Pokémon with different types and moves.
