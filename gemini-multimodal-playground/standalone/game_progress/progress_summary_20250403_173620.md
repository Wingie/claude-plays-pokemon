# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Pikachu Hunt

**Current Status:**

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest
*   **Objective:** Catch a Pikachu
*   **Progress:**  Successfully entered tall grass and encountered a wild Kakuna. A battle is currently in progress.
*   **Lead Pokémon Health:** Full HP (24/24)
*   **Battle Status:**  Engaged with a wild Kakuna.

**Recent Actions (Turns 0-9):**

The primary action in the initial turns (0-8) was attempting to enter the tall grass within Viridian Forest. Repeated attempts to move "Up" were made, but the player remained outside the tall grass, suggesting an obstacle or misjudgment of the environment. However, after repeated attempts to enter tall grass, a wild Kakuna appeared (Turn 9), triggering a battle.

**Key Discoveries & Observations:**

*   **Entering Tall Grass Challenges:**  Entering the tall grass proved more difficult than initially anticipated, requiring multiple attempts. There may be subtle variations in the terrain or hidden obstacles hindering progress.
*   **Wild Encounter:** A wild Kakuna was encountered, confirming the possibility of Pokémon appearing within Viridian Forest.
*   **Battle Commencement:** Battle with a Kakuna is in progress.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Navigation/Environment:** Difficulty in navigating the starting area and consistently entering the tall grass.
*   **Pikachu Evasion:**  No Pikachu encounter thus far.

**Strategies & Outcomes:**

*   **Repeated "Up" Movement:**  Initially, the strategy of repeatedly pressing "Up" was employed to enter the tall grass.  While ultimately successful in initiating a battle, it was a slow and inefficient approach. It highlights a need for better environmental awareness and precise movement strategies.
*   **Initiating Battle:** Commenced first move (attack) on Kakuna to progress in battle.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Defeat Kakuna:** Finish the current battle with Kakuna.
2.  **Continue Exploring Tall Grass:** Resume exploring the tall grass area, focusing on efficient movement patterns to trigger more wild encounters.
3.  **Pikachu Acquisition:** Persistently search for and attempt to catch a Pikachu.
4.  **Adjust Movement Strategy:** Refine movement strategy to more efficiently navigate the environment and enter tall grass for wild Pokémon encounters.
5.  **Inventory Check:** Confirm number of available pokeballs to be able to catch a Pikachu once it is encountered.

**Long-Term Goals:**

*   Successfully capture a Pikachu.
*   Continue exploring Viridian Forest.
*   Potentially revisit Viridian City for healing/supplies after significant exploration.
