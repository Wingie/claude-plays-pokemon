# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Approaching Viridian City. The immediate goal is to locate the Pokémart distinguished by its blue roof.
*   Currently located at position (6, 11).
*   Obstacle identified: Ledge blocking the path north.

**Recent Actions & Summary:**

*   **Repeated Rattata Encounters:** Multiple turns involved battling wild Rattata, likely in Route 1 or a similar starting area. The player consistently defeated them, but these encounters consumed turns and delayed progress towards Viridian City. Turns 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 reference this.
*   **Charmander Leveling:** Charmander gained 32 EXP, suggesting a successful battle concluded. This provides a small power boost.
*   **Navigation Attempts:** The player repeatedly attempted to move north ("up") towards Viridian City.
*   **Obstacle Recognition:** The player identified a ledge at position (6, 11) that is blocking direct northward movement.
*   **Revised Navigation Strategy:** Recognizing the ledge, the player has adjusted the strategy to move left first, then up, to circumvent the obstacle.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   **Ledge Location:** A significant ledge impedes direct passage north from the current location (6,11).
*   **Route Layout:** Initial exploration hints at a non-linear route towards Viridian City due to geographical obstacles like ledges.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Circumvent Ledge:** Continue moving left to bypass the ledge blocking the path north.
2.  **Reach Viridian City:** After clearing the ledge, resume heading north towards Viridian City.
3.  **Locate the Blue-Roofed Pokémart:** Once inside Viridian City, the primary objective is to identify the Pokémart with the blue roof.

**Insights & Challenges:**

*   **Repetitive Encounters:** The frequent wild Pokémon encounters, while providing experience, significantly slow down progress and can become tedious.
*   **Spatial Awareness:** Understanding the game world's layout and adjusting navigation strategies accordingly is crucial. The ledge represents a minor navigation puzzle.
*   **Adapting to Obstacles:** The player is demonstrating the ability to identify and adapt to obstacles, as seen in the shift from repeatedly pressing "up" to devising a route around the ledge.
