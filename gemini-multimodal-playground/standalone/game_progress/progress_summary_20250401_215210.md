# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on the "recent" turns assumption)

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, Position (5, 9).
*   **Obstacle:** A sign directly north is blocking the path.
*   **Goal:** Still needs to head north and find the blue-roofed Poké Mart in Viridian City. Progress towards this goal is currently blocked.

## Recent Actions

The last 10 turns have been dedicated to navigating around a sign located directly north of the current position (5, 9). Several strategies have been attempted:

*   **Turn 25-27:** Left, Up, Right
*   **Turn 28-30:** Right, Up, Left
*   **Turn 31:** Left, Up, Right
*   **Turn 32-34:** Right, Up, Left (Again - seems stuck in a loop)

Despite repeated attempts using these sequences, the player's position remains unchanged.

## Key Discoveries (or Lack Thereof)

*   **Consistent Obstacle:** The sign to the north consistently blocks northward movement.
*   **Ineffective Navigation:** Repeated attempts at "Left, Up, Right" and "Right, Up, Left" have failed to circumvent the obstacle.
*   **Possible Game Mechanic Issue:** The player may be facing an unintended obstacle or a bug, as these navigation methods should ideally work. It may also be an issue with the control mechanism.
*   **Loop Detected:** Player seems stuck in a logical loop of trying the same movements over and over.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Re-evaluate Navigation Strategy:** The current approach is clearly ineffective. It is necessary to critically rethink the movement pattern. Perhaps try a diagonal approach.
2.  **Verify Controls:** Ensure directional inputs are being correctly registered.
3.  **Consider Alternative Routes:** If navigating around the sign proves impossible, investigate whether there are other paths to Viridian City. Consulting a map of the area might be beneficial.
4.  **If Still Stuck - Debugging/Reset:** If all other avenues are exhausted, consider if there is an underlying problem with the game or simulation that needs to be addressed, possibly requiring a reset or debugging effort.
