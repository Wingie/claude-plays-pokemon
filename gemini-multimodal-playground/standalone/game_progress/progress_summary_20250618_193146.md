# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Level up Pikachu through wild battles.

**Current Status:** Engaged in repeated battles with wild Caterpie. We are in the initial stages of these encounters, repeatedly pressing A to advance the dialogue.

**Recent Actions:**

*   Turns 5-14 & 10, the sole action performed was pressing the 'A' button in battle. This was done to advance through the initial dialogue screen announcing the encounter with a wild Caterpie.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   **Encounter Frequency:** Caterpie appear to be a common encounter in the current area.
*   **Battle State:** The game consistently starts battles in a state where we need to advance the dialogue before any battle options ("FIGHT", "BAG", etc.) become available.

**Challenges:**

*   **Repetitive Initial State:** Each battle begins with the same initial dialogue, requiring multiple "A" button presses. This is inefficient and indicates the need to reach the move selection screen
*   **Lack of Progress:** We haven't yet reached the point of choosing a move or engaging in actual combat. Therefore, we are not yet gaining any experience points for Pikachu.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Reach Battle Menu:** Continue pressing 'A' until the battle menu ("FIGHT", "BAG", "POKEMON", "RUN") becomes visible.
2.  **Select a Move:** Once the battle menu is available, choose a suitable move for Pikachu to attack Caterpie. Consider type matchups if possible.
3.  **Evaluate Move Effectiveness:** After attacking, assess the damage dealt to Caterpie to determine the move's effectiveness and refine our strategy.
4.  **Continue Battling:** Repeat steps 1-3, prioritizing moves that effectively defeat Caterpie and maximize Pikachu's experience gain.
5.  **Monitor Pikachu's Level:** Keep track of Pikachu's experience points and level. Adjust battle frequency and location as needed to optimize leveling.
