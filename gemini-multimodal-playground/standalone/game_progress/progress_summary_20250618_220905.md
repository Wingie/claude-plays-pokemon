# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, coordinates (7, 5).
*   **HP:** 20/26 (Low).
*   **Status:** `needs_healing = true`. Currently stuck in a loop due to running out of Pokémon.

## Recent Actions (Turns 90-99)

The player has been repeatedly encountering the "Huh? I ran out of POKéMON!" message. This indicates the player has lost all available Pokémon in a battle and is blacking out. The game is placing the player back at the last visited Pokémon Center, but likely directly back into an encounter zone. The player is attempting to advance the text after blacking out and then planned to move back to the Pokemon Center for healing. The player has been attempting to get out of the grass to avoid repeated battles, but remains at the same location.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Encounter Loop:** The player is stuck in a problematic loop.  The player blacks out, is returned to the same location, and immediately re-encounters a wild Pokémon, which they cannot battle due to having no available Pokémon.
*   **Resource Depletion:** All Pokémon have fainted, leading to the blackouts.
*   **Map Dependence:** The plan involves using the map to navigate.
*   **Healing Priority:** The AI correctly identifies the need for healing when HP is low (below 30% of max HP).

## Challenges Faced

*   **Pokémon Fainted:** Primary challenge is the lack of healthy Pokémon. This prevents any further battling.
*   **Encounter Rate:** High encounter rate in the current location is preventing progress.
*   **Looping:** The game's mechanics are causing a frustrating loop, hindering any advancement. The player is effectively trapped between the last save location and the encounter zone.
*   **Navigation:** Difficulty moving out of the grass patch.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Emergency Escape:** Implement logic to prioritize escaping the grass patch immediately after reviving, before another battle is initiated.  Potentially use a Repel item if available in inventory, or priorize running from the fight.
2.  **Heal and Replenish:** Return to the Pokémon Center to heal. This has been the repeated plan, but needs to be successfully executed.
3.  **Revival Strategy:** Consider strategies for reviving fainted Pokémon (e.g., using Revives if available or returning to a previous save point to prevent the Pokemon from fainting in the first place).
4.  **Team Assessment:** Once healed, assess the current Pokémon team's levels and composition. Consider training in safer areas or adjusting the team for greater survivability.
5.  **Route Planning:** Plan a safer route to the next objective, potentially avoiding areas with high encounter rates.
