# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on completion of recent turns)
**Current Goal:** Explore the world and encounter a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently in an unknown town or city. The map is still largely unexplored.
*   **Party:** Pidgey (Health: Uncertain, last known to be at 8/25 HP, likely needs healing)
*   **Progress:** Initial exploration phase. Focused on finding landmarks and understanding the environment. We are making a concerted effort to find a Pokemon Center.
*   **Needs Healing:** Highly probable that Pidgey requires healing.

## Recent Actions (Turns 50-59)

*   **Turn 50:** Exited battle screen after Pidgey sustained damage. Initiated movement "up" in an attempt to locate a Pokemon Center, however, we were unsuccessful.
*   **Turns 51-55:** Focused on navigating toward civilization and away from the forest, making corrections in pathing, while not knowing the optimal path. The primary concern was still the low HP of Pidgey. Continued blindly moving "up" hoping to find a pokemon center.
*   **Turn 56-57:** Attempted to move towards tall grass to potentially encounter a Pikachu.
*   **Turns 58-59:** Located what appears to be a Pokemon Center in a town or city. Prioritized moving toward the Pokemon Center for healing.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Potential Pokemon Center Located:** A building matching the visual characteristics of a Pokemon Center has been identified. This is a crucial discovery, as healing is likely required.
*   **Environment Observation:** The surrounding area includes forested areas, paths, and a town/city environment. Tall grass is also present.
*   **Map Awareness:** Basic understanding of cardinal directions and movement mechanics. However, a strong sense of direction or map knowledge is lacking.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Low HP:** Pidgey's persistent low health is a major obstacle. This severely limits exploration and increases the risk of fainting.
*   **Unknown Location:** Lack of map information and location awareness makes navigation difficult and inefficient. We're relying on visual cues and assumed directions.
*   **Resource Constraints:** No potions or other healing items available.
*   **Encountering tall grass:** The agent is having difficulty getting into tall grass to find Pikachu.
*   **Overworld Healing:** Pidgey is not being healed while outside of battle.

## Strategies Employed

*   **Prioritization of Healing:** Recognizing the urgency of Pidgey's low health, prioritized finding a Pokemon Center.
*   **Directional Movement:** Used directional movement (Up, Down, Left, Right) to navigate the environment.
*   **Landmark Recognition:** Identified potential landmarks (Pokemon Center, Poke Mart) based on visual cues.
*   **Blindly following directions:** Since there is no map, a lot of time is being spent going in one direction, only to have to turn around to follow another path.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Reach and Utilize the Pokemon Center:** Prioritize reaching the identified Pokemon Center and fully healing Pidgey. This is the most critical objective.
2.  **Heal over Finding Pikachu:** The current objective is to find a Pikachu, but the priority should be healing.
3.  **Gather Information:** After healing, gather information about the surrounding area. This could involve talking to NPCs, examining signs, or exploring different parts of the town/city.
4.  **Explore for Pikachu:** Once the location is better understood and the party is healthy, resume the search for Pikachu, focusing on areas with tall grass.
5.  **Acquire Healing Items:** Purchase potions or other healing items to improve survivability during exploration.
