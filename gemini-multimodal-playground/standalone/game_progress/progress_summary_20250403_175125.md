# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Expedition

**Date:** 2024-02-29 (Assumption based on submission)

**Current Status:**

*   Exploring Viridian Forest in search of a Pikachu.
*   Currently in tall grass.
*   Lead Pokémon's HP is estimated to be relatively high, no need for healing at the moment.
*   Pokéball count unknown.
*   Encountered and defeated multiple wild Pokémon (Caterpie, Weedle) while searching.

**Recent Actions:**

*   **Initial Exploration (Turns 0-2):** Began navigating Viridian Forest, using random movement within the tall grass to trigger encounters.  Estimated current coordinates as (4,5).
*   **Caterpie Encounter (Turns 3-4):**  Engaged in battle with a wild Caterpie. Selected 'A' to advance battle text. The outcome of this battle is unknown based on the current logs.
*   **Weedle Encounters (Turns 7-11):**  Engaged in battle with a wild Weedle. Selected first move to attack and ultimately defeated the Weedle. Cleared the battle summary screen with repeated 'A' presses.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   **Viridian Forest Location:** Confirmed to be in Viridian Forest.
*   **Common Wild Pokémon:** Identified Caterpie and Weedle as common wild Pokémon in the area.
*   **Battle Strategy:** Successfully implemented a basic battle strategy: Enter battle -> Select Fight -> Select first move -> Clear battle summary (multiple 'A' presses).
*   **Improved Observation:** Gaining the ability to estimate the current coordinates and HP status through image analysis.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Random Exploration:** Current exploration strategy relies on random movement. This is inefficient and may not lead to Pikachu quickly.
*   **Unknown Resources:**  Lack of information on Pokéball count hinders the ability to strategize for catching Pokémon.
*   **Reliance on HP Estimation:** The inability to accurately determine the lead Pokémon's HP makes it difficult to determine if the lead Pokémon is in need of healing.
*   **Inefficient Battle Summary Clearing:** Clearing the battle summary requires multiple presses of the A button.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Continue Pikachu Search:** Persist with exploration of Viridian Forest, prioritizing areas where Pikachu are likely to appear (if knowledge of such locations is available). Consider a non-random exploration strategy.
2.  **Monitor HP:** Continue to monitor the lead Pokémon's HP to determine if healing is needed. Consider implementing a threshold to determine when to head back to the Viridian City PC.
3.  **Gather Resource Data:** Determine and track the number of Pokéballs currently available.
4.  **Implement Catch Strategy:** If a Pikachu is encountered, develop a strategy for weakening it and attempting to catch it.
5.  **Optimize Battle Summary Handling:** Explore ways to reduce the number of 'A' presses needed to clear the battle summary.
