# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

Currently navigating Viridian Forest. We are engaging in wild Pokémon battles to level up our starting Pokémon. We are stuck in the battle summary screen.

## Recent Actions (Turns 22-31)

*   **Turn 22:** Encountered and battled a wild Weedle. The move Scratch was used.
*   **Turns 23-31:** Cleared the battle summary screen after defeating the Weedle by repeatedly pressing the `A` button. We are stuck.

## Key Discoveries

*   Viridian Forest is populated by Weedle.
*   Scratch is an effective move against Weedle.
*   We are encountering a lot of Weedle.
*   We need to resolve the issue with the battle summary screen.
*   Pikachu has not been encountered yet.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Battle Summary Screen Lock:** The game is currently stuck in the battle summary screen, preventing further exploration. This needs to be addressed.
*   **Pikachu Encounter Rate:** Pikachu has not yet been found in Viridian Forest. Its rarity might pose a challenge.
*   **Low Level Pokémon:** Our starting Pokémon's level might become a limiting factor if tougher Pokémon are encountered later in the forest.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Resolve Battle Summary Lock:** Diagnose and fix the battle summary screen issue to resume normal gameplay. This is the highest priority.
2.  **Continue Exploration:** Once the lock is resolved, continue exploring Viridian Forest to search for Pikachu.
3.  **Level Up Pokémon:** Engage in more battles to increase the level of our Pokémon to handle potentially stronger encounters.
4.  **Optimize Search Strategy:** If Pikachu remains elusive, consider adjusting the search strategy, such as focusing on specific areas within Viridian Forest.
5.  **Acquire Poké Balls:** Ensure a sufficient supply of Poké Balls to capture Pikachu when encountered.

## Insights

*   Weedle are very common in the initial areas of Viridian Forest.
*   The A button clears battle summary screens.
*   We need to find Pikachu soon and start our way to the next gym.
