# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up Mankey through battles.

## Current Status

Our trainer is currently located in tall grass, actively searching for wild Pokémon encounters to train Mankey. Recent efforts have been focused on exploring westward paths to diversify encounter opportunities. Mankey is currently battling Pidgeys.

## Recent Actions (Turns 70-79)

*   **Turns 70-71:** Initially attempted to move upward, but became stuck in a loop. Acknowledged the need for a new strategy and identified a path to the left.
*   **Turns 72-74:** Steadily explored the path to the left, prioritizing exploration to trigger wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Turns 75-79:** Encountered and engaged in multiple battles with Pidgey. The strategy is consistently using the first attack option (Scratch) to gain experience.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Navigational Challenge:** Initial movement resulted in being stuck in a looping pattern. This highlighted the importance of strategic exploration and avoiding repetitive movements.
*   **Encounter Rate:** Tall grass is proving to be a reliable source of wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Consistent Opponent:** Pidgey is a common encounter in the current area.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Grinding Mankey:** Prioritize battling wild Pokémon to gain experience points for Mankey. Focus on maximizing efficiency by seeking out the easiest and most frequent encounters.
2.  **Explore Alternative Routes:** After the battles with Pidgey, re-evaluate the surrounding area. If Pidgey encounters become repetitive, consider exploring the path leading upwards that was identified previously to potentially discover new Pokémon types.
3.  **Monitor Mankey's Progress:** Pay attention to Mankey's level and stats to determine when it's appropriate to move on to more challenging areas.
4.  **Optimize Battle Strategy:** While Scratch is a simple attack, assess if learning new moves or utilizing items would expedite battles and increase efficiency as Mankey levels up.
