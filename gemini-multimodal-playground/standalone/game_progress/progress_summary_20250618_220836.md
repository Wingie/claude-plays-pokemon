# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, coordinates (7, 5).
*   **HP:** 20/26
*   **Status:** `needs_healing = true`
*   **Problem:** Stuck in a loop due to repeatedly encountering the "Huh? I ran out of POKéMON!" message.

## Recent Actions (Turns 85-94)

The past ten turns have been characterized by repetition and stagnation. Each turn consists of the following actions:

1.  Encountering the message "Huh? I ran out of POKéMON!" upon entering the overworld at (7,5). This indicates a previous battle has concluded, presumably with the player's Pokémon being knocked out.
2.  Identifying the need for healing due to low HP (20/26, less than 30%).
3.  Formulating a plan to:
    *   Press 'A' to advance the text.
    *   Return to the Pokémon Center for healing.
    *   Move downwards from the current location (7,5) to exit the grass area.

**Analysis:** The repeated sequence of events indicates a failure to execute the plan effectively.  We are stuck.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Consistent State:** The game state remains unchanged between turns, suggesting that pressing 'A' alone does not resolve the underlying problem.
*   **Location Trap:**  Coordinates (7, 5) appear to be a problematic location, likely within a patch of tall grass that triggers encounters even with no available Pokémon.
*  **Need Healing:** HP remains low despite the planned healing, indicating the character has not made it to a Pokemon Center.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Break the Loop:**  The primary objective is to escape the current loop. Since simply pressing 'A' is ineffective, we need to modify the strategy. Possible solutions include:
    *   **Prioritize Movement:** Immediately after pressing 'A', attempt to move *away* from (7,5) before another encounter can trigger. Implement a sequence of downward movements immediately after pressing 'A'.
    *   **Inventory Management:** (If available) Check the inventory for items like potions or revives to heal Pokémon before moving. This would allow for more battles and prevent running out of Pokémon again.
    *   **Re-evaluate Route:**  If downward movement proves ineffective, reconsider the map and identify an alternative, safer route to the Pokémon Center.
2.  **Heal at Pokémon Center:** Once the loop is broken, prioritize returning to the Pokémon Center to fully heal.
3.  **Refine Battle Strategy:** After healing, analyze why all Pokémon fainted in the previous battles. Develop a more effective battle strategy, potentially involving leveling up existing Pokémon or catching new ones.
4.  **Resume Story Progression:** Once the immediate crisis is resolved, continue the primary goal of finding and winning Pokémon battles to progress through the game.
