# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

Our Pidgey is now at **Level 5** and has learned the move **SAND-ATTACK**. We are currently in the overworld at position (5, 11), near a small opening surrounded by trees to the right and bottom. Our focus remains on finding and engaging in battles to gain experience and learn more about combat mechanics.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turn 90-95:** Successfully defeated a wild Pidgey, earning experience points and leveling up our own Pidgey to Level 5. Pidgey also learned the move Sand-Attack during this battle. We repeatedly advanced through the battle sequence confirmations.
*   **Turn 96-99:** Returned to the overworld and are currently exploring the area to the north, aiming to encounter new Pokémon and initiate battles. We are currently located near the starting area, navigating a small opening surrounded by trees.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Leveling Up:** We have successfully increased our Pidgey's level through combat.
*   **New Move:** Our Pidgey learned the move SAND-ATTACK, which will likely be helpful in future battles.
*   **Overworld Navigation:** We are becoming more familiar with the overworld map and basic navigation.  Currently we are hampered by repetitive actions to advance from battle screens.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Explore North:** Continue moving north from the current position (5, 11) to explore the opening and increase the chances of encountering wild Pokémon.
2.  **Engage in Battles:** Actively seek out and engage in battles with wild Pokémon to further level up our Pidgey and learn new moves.
3.  **Master Battle Mechanics:** Focus on understanding the effectiveness of different moves and developing battle strategies. Specifically understand how Sand-Attack affects combat.
4.  **Reduce Repetitive Actions:** Find a faster way to advance through the level up screens without requiring multiple 'A' button presses.
