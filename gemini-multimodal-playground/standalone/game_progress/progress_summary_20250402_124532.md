# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:** Exploring tall grass area, searching for wild Pokémon to battle and gain experience. Pidgey has learned the move Sand-Attack.

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Recent Actions:

*   **Turns 0-4:** Repeatedly moved upwards in tall grass, presumably searching for wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Turn 95:** Engaged in a battle (details of the battle itself are missing from the turns). Pidgey learned Sand-Attack.
*   **Turns 96-99:** Returned to the overworld at position (5, 11) and observed the surrounding environment. Determined to continue moving north through the opening in the trees in order to find more battles.

## Key Discoveries:

*   **Movement:** We are able to move in the overworld, presumably one tile at a time.
*   **Wild Pokémon Encounters:** Moving in tall grass leads to wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Move Learning:** Pokémon can learn new moves through battle experience (Pidgey learned Sand-Attack).
*   **Location:** We are currently located at position (5, 11) in an area surrounded by trees on the right and bottom, with an opening to the north.
*   **Mapping:** Simple awareness of local environment is maintained: trees to the right/bottom and opening to the north.

## Challenges:

*   **Lack of Battle Details:** The provided turns do not specify the types of Pokémon encountered or the outcome of the battle where Pidgey learned Sand-Attack. This makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of current strategies.
*   **Slow Progress:** Repeatedly stating the goal of finding battles highlights a potential lack of progress or efficiency in locating wild Pokémon.

## Next Objectives:

1.  **Continue moving north:** As the current location has trees blocking movement to the right and below, continue moving up to find new areas with a higher chance of encountering wild Pokemon.
2.  **Engage in more battles:** Seek out and engage in battles with wild Pokémon to gain experience and level up Pidgey.
3.  **Record Battle Information:** Begin tracking the types of Pokémon encountered and the outcome of battles to better understand the effectiveness of Pidgey and plan future strategies. Track locations of battles for patterns.
4.  **Experiment with Sand-Attack:** Now that Pidgey knows Sand-Attack, begin using the move in battle to see how it affects the opponent.
