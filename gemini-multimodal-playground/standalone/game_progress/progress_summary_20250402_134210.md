*   **Party:**
    *   Pidgey: Level 9, 24/27 HP. Knows Tackle, Sand-Attack, and Gust.
*   **Status Effects:** None.
*   **In Battle:** No.
*   **Needs Healing:** No.

## II. Recent Actions

*   **Battles:**
    *   Encountered and defeated a Rattata.
    *   Pidgey leveled up to level 9 and learned Gust.
*   **Level-Up Screen Management:** Repeatedly exited the level-up screen after Pidgey gained a level.
*   **Strategy:** Prioritized using Gust during the Rattata battle, likely due to type advantage.

## III. Key Discoveries

*   **Combat Mechanics:** Gained experience in battling wild Pokémon.

*   **Leveling:** Pidgey gained a level (from level 8 to level 9).

## IV. Obstacles Faced

*   **Level-Up Screen Loop:** Briefly stuck in the level-up screen, requiring repeated button presses to exit.
*   **Pikachu Encounter Rate:** Still haven't encountered a Pikachu despite active searching.

## V. Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Exploring Tall Grass:** The primary focus remains on exploring the tall grass to increase the chance of encountering a Pikachu.
2.  **Level Up Pidgey:** A secondary objective is to continue leveling up Pidgey, ideally to level 10-15.
3.  **Evaluate Team Needs:** Once a Pikachu is obtained, assess the overall team composition and potentially look for other Pokémon to add to the party.
4.  **Identify Location:** Attempt to identify the current location on the map.

## VI. Strategic Considerations

*   **Gust Usage:** Continue to leverage Gust's type advantage against Normal-type Pokémon.
*   **Resource Management:** Monitor Pidgey's HP and consider using healing items if necessary.
*   **Pikachu Location:** Research potential Pikachu spawn locations to optimize the search strategy.
*   **Training:** Look for trainer battles, as they can yield higher EXP for faster pokemon growth.
