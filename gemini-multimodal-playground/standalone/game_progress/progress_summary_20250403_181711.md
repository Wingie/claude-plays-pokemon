# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** Current Date

**Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, likely still within or near Viridian Forest. Coordinates are (7,5).
*   **Party:** Pikachu (Lead Pokémon, 14/19 HP).
*   **General Progress:** Emerging from a stuck-in-battle loop. Now able to reliably navigate the overworld and enter battles.

## II. Recent Actions & Analysis (Turns 10-19)

The recent turns have been a rollercoaster of challenges and small victories.

*   **Turns 10-12: Stuck in Battle Loop:** Initial turns were plagued by an inability to correctly identify the battle menu. The AI repeatedly selected moves incorrectly or got "stuck" attempting to run from a battle it couldn't properly interact with. This highlighted the need for more robust observation, specifically verifying the presence of core battle menu options ("FIGHT", "BAG", etc.).
*   **Turns 13-16: Overworld Navigation:** Having escaped the battle loop, the AI successfully recognized the overworld state and repeatedly attempted to move right, presumably into the grass, to trigger wild Pokémon encounters. This demonstrates a successful execution of the primary objective.
*   **Turns 17-19: Re-engaging Battle:** Encounters Rattata, correctly identifies the battle screen, selects Thunder shock and takes action. Now is caught in a similar loop as before.

**Key Challenges Encountered:**

*   **Robust State Observation:** Accurate state detection is critical. The initial implementation struggled to differentiate between different battle states and correctly interpret the available options.
*   **Looping Behavior:** Recurring actions without a change in game state. This stems from incomplete information and the inability to progress through the battle sequence.
*   **Priority of Actions:** When HP is low, healing and running actions should have a higher priority than leveling up.

## III. Key Discoveries

*   **Importance of Detailed Observation:** The AI needs to verify specific text and UI elements to confirm the game state accurately.
*   **Overworld Navigation Functionality:** The AI demonstrates a basic understanding of navigating the overworld to find wild encounters.

## IV. Next Objectives

*   **Improve Battle State Management:** Implement more precise observation of the battle screen, including checking for opponent Pokémon, available moves, and message boxes.
*   **Prioritize Actions:** If HP is low, heal or flee first.
*   **Break the Current Battle Loop:** Determine what action will progress the Rattata battle beyond using Growl and advancing the dialog.
*   **Level Up Pokémon:** Continue engaging in battles and defeating wild Pokémon to level up the team.
*   **Optimize Move Selection:** Analyze Pokémon type matchups and select moves accordingly for maximum effectiveness.
