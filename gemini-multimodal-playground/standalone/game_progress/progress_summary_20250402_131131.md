# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Gameplay Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   **Location:** Tall Grass (Likely Route 1)
*   **Lead Pokémon:** Healthy (21/21 HP)
*   **Objective:** Finding and winning Pokémon battles in the tall grass.

**Recent Actions (Turns 35-44):**

The last ten turns have been a cycle of battling, recognizing low HP, seeking healing at the Viridian City Pokémon Center, and returning to the tall grass.

*   **Initial Challenge:** Early turns were characterized by uncertainty regarding the player's location. After battles left the lead Pokémon with low HP, the player did not know the location of the pokemon center. Therefore, they had to perform exploratory moves and utilize game state observations to infer their position and navigate toward the Pokémon Center in Viridian City.

*   **Healing Run:** After the location of the Pokemon Center was discovered in Viridian City, the player successfully located and used the Pokémon Center to fully restore their lead Pokémon's HP. This involved navigating to the nurse, advancing through dialogue, and exiting the facility.

*   **Menu Navigation Issues:** A couple of turns (41-43) were spent recovering from accidentally entering a menu, and navigating the menu to return to the normal world view. This highlights the importance of precise control in gameplay.

*   **Return to the Hunt:** Successfully transitioned back to the tall grass after exiting the Pokémon Center and town. The plan is now to trigger random encounters.

**Key Discoveries & Insights:**

*   **Location Awareness:** The player's initial location awareness was poor, highlighting a need for better spatial reasoning and navigation strategies. This was addressed by inferring the location using surrounding game state observations.
*   **HP Threshold:** Established a 30% HP threshold for needing healing.
*   **Viridian City Landmark:** The Pokémon Center in Viridian City is a known and accessible healing location.
*   **Menu Mishaps:**  Accidental menu entries can disrupt flow and require recovery steps.
*   **Inference from Actions:** The ability to infer the game state (e.g., being in tall grass) based on recent actions is crucial for decision-making.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Engage in Pokémon Battles:** Now in the tall grass with a healthy Pokémon, the primary goal is to find and win battles to gain experience.
2.  **Implement a Smarter Grass Exploration Strategy:** Rather than purely random movements, consider more strategic patterns (e.g., systematically covering the grass area).
3.  **Monitor HP:** Continuously monitor the lead Pokémon's HP and return to the Pokémon Center when the 30% threshold is met.
