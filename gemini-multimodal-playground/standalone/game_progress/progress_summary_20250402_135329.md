# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Pikachu Hunt

**Current Status:**

*   Exploring Viridian Forest, actively searching for a Pikachu to catch.
*   Lead Pokémon: Pidgey, Level 10, HP Full (but this data may not be up to date).
*   Currently outside the Viridian City Pokémon Center, re-entering Viridian Forest to continue the search.

**Recent Actions:**

*   Initial exploration of Viridian Forest (turns 0, 1, 2, 7, 8) involving random movement in tall grass to trigger encounters.
*   Engaged in multiple battles with wild Pidgey (turns 0, 1, 2, 1). This was primarily for training purposes, as the focus is on finding Pikachu.  Gust was identified as the likely best offensive move.
*   Accidentally entered the Viridian City Pokémon Center (turn 3) and subsequently exited (turn 4), requiring navigation back to Viridian Forest.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Pidgey is a common encounter in Viridian Forest.
*   Identified the "Fight -> Gust -> A" sequence as the most effective battle strategy against Pidgey (assuming Pidgey is still the lead Pokemon).
*   Recognized the need to carefully navigate the overworld map to ensure optimal pathing back to the forest after inadvertently entering the Pokémon Center.
*   Tall grass is required for wild Pokémon encounters.
*   Current coordinates are tracked (at least approximately) to aid in navigation, helping return to the forest after getting sidetracked.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Pikachu Elusiveness:** Despite entering Viridian Forest, Pikachu has not been encountered.
*   **Repetitive Encounters:** Frequent battles with Pidgey are hindering progress toward finding Pikachu.
*   **Overworld Navigation:** Inadvertently entered the Pokémon Center, requiring backtracking.  This highlights the need for more careful navigation.
*   **Limited Information:** Move lists were initially unavailable, requiring assumed gameplay and potentially suboptimal move choices.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Return to Viridian Forest:** Navigate back into the tall grass to resume the search for Pikachu.
2.  **Optimize Encounter Rate:** Continue random movement within tall grass, prioritizing areas not yet explored.
3.  **Pikachu Capture Strategy:** Develop a capture strategy for Pikachu *when* it is encountered (e.g., weaken with Tackle, then use Poké Ball). This will be planned in advance when the first Pikachu is encountered.
4.  **Coordinate Tracking:** Maintain accurate coordinate tracking in order to re-enter the forest.

**Strategy Review:**

*   Random movement in tall grass is currently the only exploration strategy. Consider implementing a more structured search pattern.

**Future Considerations:**

*   If Pikachu remains elusive, explore potential alternative locations or methods for encountering it within Viridian Forest (if any exist).
*   Gather more information about the lead Pokémon's stats, moves, and item inventory for more informed decision-making.
*   Consider using Repels (if available) to reduce the frequency of Pidgey encounters if they are hindering the Pikachu search.
