# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, surrounded by tall grass and trees to the right.
*   **Pokémon:** At least one Pokémon, Pidgey, is currently in the party.
*   **Progress:** Exploring the tall grass to initiate battles.
*   **Challenges:** Consistently reiterating the goal, indicating difficulty in understanding or implementing the strategy effectively.

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 50-59)

*   **Turns 50-51:** Engaged in battles where Pidgey gained 12 EXP each. Actions were halted awaiting player input (pressing A to continue).
*   **Turns 52-58:** Exploration focused on navigating the overworld. Repeated movement "up" into tall grass, likely to trigger random encounters. Goal reiteration suggests active searching for battles.
*   **Turn 59:** Battle initiated successfully. The player declared the intention to attack.

## III. Key Discoveries

*   **Overworld Environment:** The player is in an area with tall grass, a typical environment for encountering wild Pokémon. Trees are visible to the right, suggesting a potential boundary or area of interest.
*   **Battle Mechanics:** Basic battle actions yield experience points (Pidgey gained 12 EXP per battle).
*   **Battle Initiation:** Walking in tall grass triggers battles.

## IV. Next Objectives

1.  **Complete Current Battle:** Execute the planned attack in the current battle initiated in turn 59 and continue until the battle concludes.
2.  **Continue Exploring Tall Grass:** If the current battle is successful, continue exploring the tall grass to gain more experience and potentially catch new Pokémon.
3.  **Refine Movement Strategy:** Possibly explore moving in different directions (left, right, down) to find different encounter areas or Pokémon.
4.  **Monitor Pokémon Growth:** Pay attention to Pidgey's level and learned moves.
5. **Investigate the Trees:** After establishing a grasp of the basic battles, explore past the tree line.

## V. Analysis & Insights

The player has identified the tall grass as a source of battles and is actively pursuing them to gain experience. Repetitive turns suggest difficulty in understanding basic movement controls or in quickly identifying when battles are initiated. Focus should be placed on streamlining the process of entering and completing battles.
