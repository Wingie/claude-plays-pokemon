# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore the world and encounter/capture a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, likely Route 3 (based on common Pidgey encounters).
*   **Party:**
    *   Pidgey: Level 8, HP: 17/25.  Knows Tackle and Sand-Attack.
*   **Objective Status:**  Still searching for a Pikachu. Progress impeded by frequent wild Pidgey encounters.

## Recent Actions (Turns 10-19)

The last several turns have been primarily focused on battling a wild Pidgey.  Initial turns (10-12) involved repeatedly entering tall grass to trigger random encounters in the hopes of finding a Pikachu. Turn 13 initiated the battle with the Pidgey, which has persisted for several turns. During the battle, the player's Pidgey has taken some damage.  The player's strategy has been primarily to select the first available move (initially unknown, later identified as Tackle).

*   **Turns 10-12:** Entered tall grass to trigger wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Turns 13-19:** Engaged in a prolonged battle with a wild Pidgey. Repeatedly used Tackle as the primary offensive move.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Battle Mechanics:** The player has established a basic understanding of battle mechanics, including selecting moves.
*   **Pidgey Location:** Confirmed Pidgey are common in the current area, implying Route 3 as likely location.
*   **Move Set:** The player's Pidgey knows at least two moves: Tackle and Sand-Attack (deduced from turn 18).
*   **HP Threshold:**  The system determines when HP is low enough to warrant healing.

## Challenges

*   **Pikachu Elusiveness:**  Pikachu has not been encountered, highlighting its relative rarity in the early game.
*   **Repetitive Encounters:** Frequent Pidgey battles are hindering progress towards the primary goal.
*   **Limited Information:** The player has been operating with limited information about the available moves and their effectiveness, necessitating a reactive approach.
*   **Resource Management:** While not critical yet, the Pidgey's health is declining, suggesting that healing items or a Pokémon Center visit may be necessary soon if battles continue.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Defeat the Pidgey:** Finish the current battle.
2.  **Continue Pikachu Search:** Resume exploring the tall grass, prioritizing areas less likely to spawn Pidgey (if known).
3.  **Consider Strategy Diversification:** Given the lack of progress, consider alternative approaches to finding a Pikachu, such as consulting online resources or attempting to progress to a new area with different encounter tables.
4. **Monitor HP and Healing:** Pay close attention to the Pidgey's HP and prepare to use healing items or visit a Pokémon Center if needed to avoid fainting.
