# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest

**Date:** Current Date (Based on provided turns)

**Overall Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest (Coordinates: 11, 4)
*   **Health:** Healthy (No healing needed)
*   **Objective Status:** Currently stuck in the Battle Summary screen after defeating a Weedle. Progress in exploring the forest is halted.

## Recent Actions (Turns 17-26)

*   Repeatedly engaged in battle with a Weedle (implied, based on Battle Summary screen).
*   Successfully defeated the Weedle.
*   Spent the last ten turns attempting to exit the Battle Summary screen, consistently pressing the 'A' button as planned.
*   There is either an issue with the game logic or the execution of the 'A' button press is not registering correctly, as the game has remained stuck in the Battle Summary for the last several turns.

## Key Discoveries

*   Weedle encounters are frequent in the current location (11,4) of Viridian Forest.
*   We are currently unable to progress due to being stuck in the Battle Summary screen.

## Obstacles Faced

*   **Stuck in Battle Summary:** The primary obstacle is the inability to exit the Battle Summary screen after defeating a Weedle. This prevents further exploration and progress towards the goal of catching a Pikachu.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Troubleshoot Battle Summary Lock:** Investigate why the game is stuck in the Battle Summary screen. This might involve:
    *   Verifying the correct implementation of the 'A' button press.
    *   Checking for any potential errors or glitches in the game or emulator (if applicable).
    *   Trying alternative inputs to clear the screen (e.g., different buttons).
2.  **Resume Exploration:** Once the Battle Summary issue is resolved, continue exploring Viridian Forest.
3.  **Pikachu Search:** Focus on searching for Pikachu, utilizing knowledge of potential spawn locations within the forest (if available).
4.  **Catch a Pikachu:** Attempt to catch a Pikachu using Poké Balls.

## Insights and Strategies

*   **Strategy Failure:** Repeatedly pressing 'A' to exit the Battle Summary has been unsuccessful so far. A different approach is required.
*   **Potential Issue:** The consistent Battle Summary lock suggests a potential bug or error in the current setup.

## Action Items

*   Diagnose and resolve the Battle Summary screen issue.
*   Continue Viridian Forest exploration upon resolution.
