# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 27, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up Pikachu through battles.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Stuck in battle.
*   **Party:** Pikachu (HP: 14/20).
*   **Objective Status:** Partially failed. We attempted to level up Pikachu but are currently stuck in a battle loop.

## Recent Actions (Turns 65-74)

*   Engaged in battle with a Wild CATERPIE.
*   CATERPIE fainted.
*   Due to a suspected bug, the game is stuck on the move selection screen *after* the opponent has fainted.
*   Repeatedly attempted to advance the dialogue by pressing 'A' to exit the battle. No progress.

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Game Bug:** Encountered a persistent bug where the game fails to properly exit a battle after defeating a Wild CATERPIE, leaving us stuck on the move selection screen.
*   **Pikachu's Condition:** Pikachu's HP is low (14/20), indicating a need for healing once we resolve the bug.
*   **Repetitive Strategy:** Attempting to repeatedly press 'A' has not resolved the bug. This strategy has proven ineffective in its current form.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Battle Loop Bug:** This is the primary obstacle, preventing progression beyond the current battle. It directly hinders our ability to level up Pikachu.
*   **Low Pikachu HP:** While not immediately critical, Pikachu's low HP means we are vulnerable in subsequent battles (once we escape the bug).

## Next Objectives

1.  **Escape the Battle Loop:** We need to find a way to break out of this persistent battle screen bug. Possible strategies to consider include:
    *   **Soft Reset:** Attempt a soft reset of the game (usually a button combination).
    *   **Alternative Input:** Try pressing other buttons in a specific sequence to see if it triggers an exit.
    *   **Re-examine Emulator/Environment:** If applicable, look into settings that may affect the game's behavior, such as fast-forward features or frame skipping.
2.  **Heal Pikachu:** Once free from the battle loop, prioritize healing Pikachu's HP.
3.  **Resume Leveling:** Return to the original objective of finding suitable battles to level up Pikachu. This may involve exploring different areas to find appropriate wild Pokémon.

## Notes

The game appears to be malfunctioning. Prioritizing a solution to the battle loop is critical for continued progress. We may need to explore emulator settings or game reset options.
