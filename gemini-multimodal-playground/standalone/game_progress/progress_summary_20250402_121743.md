# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Report Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on provided turns)

**Current Goal:** Train Mankey through battles.

## Current Status

The primary focus is currently on leveling up our Mankey. We are consistently engaging in wild Pokémon battles, primarily against Rattata. One Rattata was defeated. Mankey's current level and specific stats are not yet known, but the strategy is to consistently use the attack "Scratch."

## Recent Actions (Turns 50-59)

*   **Engaged in multiple battles with wild Rattata.** The predominant action during these turns involved initiating battles with Rattata and selecting the "Scratch" attack.
*   **One Rattata Fainted.** After repeated Scratch attacks, one Rattata was defeated.
*   **Repeatedly selected the first attack option (Scratch).** This strategy has been consistently applied in all battles.
*   **Advanced through the battle sequence.** After the Rattata fainted, the A button was pressed to advance to the next step.

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Rattata Encounter Rate:** Rattata appears to be a common encounter in the current area, providing ample opportunities for training.
*   **"Scratch" as Primary Attack:**  "Scratch" is the chosen attack for Mankey, indicating it's currently the most effective or only available attack option.
*   **Monotony of Grinding:** The report highlights the repetitive nature of training at this stage. We are essentially grinding against a single Pokémon type using a single attack.

## Challenges

*   **Grinding is Slow:** Leveling up seems to be a slow and repetitive process, potentially leading to tedium.
*   **Risk of Fainting:** The constant battling could lead to Mankey fainting if we are not careful. The report doesn't mention healing items or strategies to address this.
*   **Lack of Variety:** Battling only Rattata limits experience gain and exposure to different types of Pokémon.

## Next Objectives

*   **Continue Battling Rattata:** Continue to battle Rattata until Mankey reaches a desired level or learns new moves.
*   **Monitor Mankey's Stats:** Track Mankey's experience points and level to determine progress and consider when to move to a new training location.
*   **Consider Healing:** Acquire or utilize healing items to prevent Mankey from fainting during battles.
*   **Explore Alternative Training Locations:** Once Mankey has reached a sufficient level, investigate other areas with potentially stronger or more varied Pokémon to battle for faster leveling.
*   **Evaluate Mankey's Moveset:**  As Mankey levels up, evaluate new moves and determine if a change in strategy is warranted.
*   **Progress the Main Story:** While training Mankey is important, remember to progress the main story to unlock new areas and opportunities.
