# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 15 - 24

**Current Goal:** Find battles to fight Pokémon and attempt to catch wild ones.

## Current Status

Currently located *inside* the Pokémon Center in Pallet Town. Progress towards the primary goal of finding battles and catching Pokémon has stalled due to repeated accidental re-entry into the Pokémon Center. Focus needs to shift to efficiently exiting Pallet Town.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 15-19:** Trapped in dialog with Nurse Joy. Multiple "A" button presses to advance through the conversation.
*   **Turn 20:** Successfully exited the Pokémon Center and found the overworld, initially heading North towards Route 1.
*   **Turns 21-23:** Accidental re-entry into the Pokémon Center. Attempts to exit the building by pressing up and down.
*   **Turn 24:** Ended up in a menu inside the Pokémon Center asking "Which topic do you want to read?".

## Key Discoveries and Observations

*   **Difficulty with Navigation:** Accidental re-entry into the Pokémon Center highlights difficulty with precise movement and navigation in the early game.
*   **Importance of Context:** Recognizing the environment (overworld vs. building interior, dialog screen vs. menu) is crucial for making correct decisions.
*   **Goal Clarity:** Maintaining focus on the core objective (finding battles and catching Pokemon) helps to avoid distractions and backtracking.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Getting Stuck in Dialog:** Lengthy NPC dialogs can be time-consuming and require repetitive button presses.
*   **Accidental Re-entry:**  Difficulty exiting buildings highlights the need for precise movement and awareness of surroundings.
*   **Menu Misinterpretation:** Accidentally opening the "Which topic do you want to read?" menu indicates a need for clearer understanding of menu options and controls.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Exit the Pokémon Center:** Select "EXIT" from the current menu ("Which topic do you want to read?")
2.  **Navigate North to Route 1:** Once outside, head directly north from Pallet Town to reach Route 1.
3.  **Engage in Battles:** Explore the tall grass on Route 1 to encounter wild Pokémon and initiate battles.
4.  **Catch Wild Pokémon:** Attempt to catch encountered Pokémon using Poké Balls.
5. **Avoid Re-Entry**: While approaching doors, be sure to only move one square, and then press A to enter, and repeat the process when exiting.

## Strategic Considerations

*   **Prioritize Navigation:** Before engaging in other actions, ensure the character is moving in the correct direction towards the desired location.
*   **Context-Aware Actions:** Pay close attention to the environment and on-screen prompts to avoid making incorrect choices.
*   **Inventory Management:** When catching Pokémon becomes a priority, ensure an adequate supply of Poké Balls.
