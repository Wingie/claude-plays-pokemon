**Current Goal:** Train Mankey through wild Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, surrounded by tall grass.
*   **Position:** (0, 8)
*   **Objective:** Actively seeking wild Pokémon encounters within the tall grass to level up Mankey.
*   **Obstacle:** A line of trees is impeding direct upward movement into the tall grass.

## Recent Actions

*   **Repetitive Exploration:** Several turns focused on moving "up" within the tall grass in an attempt to trigger a battle.
*   **Navigation Attempt:** Identified an obstacle (trees) preventing upward movement.
*   **Revised Strategy:** Initiated a rightward movement to circumvent the trees and access more of the tall grass.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Tall Grass = Wild Encounters:** The tall grass is confirmed as the primary location for encountering wild Pokémon battles.
*   **Terrain Limitations:** The presence of trees acts as a navigational obstacle, requiring alternate routes.
*   **Coordinate Awareness:** We've established positional awareness within the game world (0,8), allowing for more informed movement decisions.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Tree Circumvention:** Continue moving right to navigate around the trees blocking access to the rest of the tall grass.
2.  **Wild Pokémon Encounter:** Once past the trees, resume aggressive exploration of the tall grass to initiate wild Pokémon battles.
3.  **Mankey Training:** Focus on engaging in battles and gaining experience to level up Mankey.
4.  **Coordinate Optimization:** Track movement and map the surrounding area to better understand the terrain and find the most efficient path to potential battle zones.
