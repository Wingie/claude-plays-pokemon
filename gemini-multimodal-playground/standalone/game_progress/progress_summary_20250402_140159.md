# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Exploration

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest (in tall grass)
*   **Party Leader:** Pidgey
    *   HP: 24/29
    *   Status: Healthy
*   **Objective:** Still searching for Pikachu.

## Recent Actions (Turns 20-29)

Our journey into Viridian Forest began cautiously. Initially outside the tall grass (Turn 20), we moved into it to initiate wild Pokémon encounters (Turn 21). Following that, we randomly moved around in the grass to trigger a wild pokemon encounter. We triggered a battle with a wild Caterpie on turn 22.

The majority of recent turns (22-27) were consumed by a protracted battle with a Caterpie. We consistently chose to attack with our Pidgey's first move. Turns 28 and 29 involved clearing the battle summary after finally defeating the Caterpie.

## Key Discoveries and Challenges

*   **Encountered:** Caterpie.
*   **Challenge:** Prolonged battle with a Caterpie. Our current strategy of using the first move is effective but time-consuming.
*   **Insight:** Tall grass triggers wild Pokémon encounters.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Exploring:** Resume exploring the tall grass within Viridian Forest.
2.  **Seek Pikachu:** Prioritize encountering and attempting to catch a Pikachu.
3.  **Re-evaluate Battle Strategy:** Consider whether the 'attack with first move' strategy is the most efficient for future encounters, especially against weaker Pokémon. If a more efficient strategy can be found, implement it.
4.  **Monitor HP:** Continue monitoring Pidgey's HP and prioritize healing if necessary to avoid fainting.
