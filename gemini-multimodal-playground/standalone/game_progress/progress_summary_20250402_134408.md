# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Report Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore the world and try to encounter a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Party:** Currently only using Pidgey.
*   **Pidgey HP:** Relatively healthy at 22/27 HP. Sustaining minor damage during battles.
*   **Location:** Still exploring the initial areas, likely Route 1 or Route 2, searching for a Pikachu.
*   **Progress:** Primarily engaging in repetitive battles with common wild Pokémon.

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 25-34)

*   **Focus:** Primarily focused on battling wild Pokémon to gain experience and explore the initial routes.
*   **Battle Encounters:** Predominantly facing Caterpie and Rattata.
*   **Move Usage:** Reliant on Pidgey's Tackle as the primary and possibly only attack move.
*   **Battle Strategy:** Consistently selecting "Fight" and then the first available move (Tackle). This strategy is functional, but potentially inefficient depending on type matchups.
*   **Healing:** No healing actions were taken as damage has been minimal, but monitoring Pidgey's HP is crucial.

## III. Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Common Pokémon:** The area is populated by Caterpie and Rattata. Encountering a Pikachu may require moving to a different location or persisting with the current area for a lower probability encounter.
*   **Move Set Limitation:** Pidgey's limited move set (primarily Tackle) makes battles somewhat repetitive. Acquiring new moves will be necessary for more efficient combat and variety.
*   **Sustained Damage:** While minimal, the consistent chip damage from wild Pokémon highlights the importance of carrying Potions or utilizing Pokémon Centers to avoid being caught off guard by a critical hit or a stronger encounter.
*   **No Pikachu sighting:** Have not encountered a Pikachu yet.

## IV. Next Objectives

*   **Continue the search for Pikachu:** Persist in exploring the current area. Consider exploring adjacent routes if Pikachu is not commonly found.
*   **Monitor Pidgey's Health:** Pay close attention to Pidgey's HP. Consider using a Potion or visiting a Pokémon Center if HP falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 10 HP).
*   **Level Up Pidgey:** Continue battling wild Pokémon to level up Pidgey. Gaining levels increases stats and potentially unlocks new moves, which would improve combat effectiveness.
*   **Consider Catching Other Pokémon:** While the primary goal is Pikachu, consider catching other Pokémon to diversify the party and provide backup options in case of unfavorable matchups. This requires Poké Balls.
*   **Investigate Route Variations:** If the current route offers only Caterpie and Rattata, research and determine when and how to access other routes to find Pikachu.
