# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 30-39

**Current Goal:** Find battles to train Mankey.

## Current Status

We are currently navigating a route with tall grass and a path leading upwards. Mankey is our primary focus for training. We have not yet engaged in any battles during this reporting period.

## Recent Actions

The primary action during this period has been exploration, specifically moving "up" on a path surrounded by tall grass in search of wild Pokémon encounters. After encountering a potential "loop" in our movement, we briefly considered moving "right" before returning to the upwards path.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

*   **Turns 30-35, 37-39:** Consistent movement "up" along the path, repeatedly hoping to trigger a battle in the tall grass.
*   **Turn 36:** Acknowledged a possible looping pattern and briefly considered deviating to the right before resuming the upward path.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Terrain:** The area consists of a path surrounded by tall grass and trees. This indicates a higher likelihood of wild Pokémon encounters within the tall grass.
*   **Potential Looping:** Possible repetitive layout or our movements are causing us to loop in the same area. We need to be mindful of this.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Lack of Encounters:** Despite consistent exploration of tall grass, we have not triggered any wild Pokémon battles to train Mankey.
*   **Possible Navigation Issue:** There is a potential for getting stuck in a loop, necessitating a change in strategy if it persists.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Prioritize Battle Encounters:** Continue exploring the tall grass while focusing on areas we haven't thoroughly investigated yet.
2.  **Map the Area:** Attempt to mentally map the layout of the area to avoid looping and identify potential dead ends or alternative routes.
3.  **Consider Item Use:** If battle encounters remain infrequent, consider using items that increase encounter rates (if available and accessible).
4.  **Strategic Deviation:** If the current path continues to yield no encounters, abandon the upward trajectory and explore alternate routes, paying close attention to the surroundings.
5.  **Party Review:** In the (likely) event that Mankey still isn't facing battles, is Mankey even in the active party? Is it at the front of the party, leading to an encounter?
