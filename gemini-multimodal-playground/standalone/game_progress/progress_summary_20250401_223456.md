# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Navigate to Viridian City and locate the blue-roofed PokeMart.

## Current Status

We are currently located south of Viridian Forest, attempting to navigate around obstacles to reach Viridian City. Progress has been slow due to the presence of ledges and non-player characters (NPCs) obstructing the direct path north.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 51-54:** Attempted to bypass a ledge and an NPC by moving right. This strategy proved ineffective as the obstacles persisted.
*   **Turns 55-58:** Continued attempting to move north, approaching the forest edge.
*   **Turn 59:** Encountered a trainer blocking the path north. Initiated interaction (talk) with the trainer.
*   **Turns 63-64:** Continued moving north, approaching the forest edge.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Terrain Obstacles:** Ledges prevent direct southward movement and necessitate finding alternative routes.
*   **NPC Obstructions:** Non-player characters (NPCs), including trainers, are positioned in the environment and impede movement, requiring strategic navigation or interaction.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Engage the Trainer:** Initiate a battle with the trainer blocking the path to the north.
2.  **Proceed to Viridian City:** After dealing with the trainer, continue north towards Viridian City.
3.  **Locate PokeMart:** Upon entering Viridian City, identify the PokeMart with the blue roof.
