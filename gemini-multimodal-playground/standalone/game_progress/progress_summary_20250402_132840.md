# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on context of "recent turns")

**Objective:** Explore the world and encounter a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Recently inside Gary's (Blue's) house in Pallet Town, after receiving the Town Map from Daisy. Currently attempting to exit the house.
*   **Party:** Lead Pokémon is a level 7 Pokémon named "MAN" with full HP (22/22). Moveset currently unknown, but Scratch has been used.
*   **Items:** Town Map.
*   **Primary Goal:** Still focused on finding a Pikachu in the tall grass. This was temporarily interrupted to receive the Town Map.

## Recent Actions (Summarized)

*   **Initial Exploration:** Began exploring the overworld with the intention of entering tall grass to trigger encounters and search for Pikachu.
*   **Wild Rattata Encounters:** Experienced multiple battles with wild Rattata (Level 2). Successfully defeated them using the lead Pokémon, MAN. Used the move "Scratch."
*   **Daisy Interaction:** Entered Gary's house and received the Town Map from Daisy. Spent multiple turns navigating dialogue and menus related to this interaction.
*   **Attempting to Exit House:** Currently trying to exit Gary's house after receiving the Town Map.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Wild Pokémon Encounters:** Regular wild Pokémon battles are triggered in tall grass. Confirmed encounters with Rattata.
*   **Town Map Acquisition:** Successfully obtained the Town Map from Daisy in Gary's house.
*   **Gary's House Location:** Located Gary's house in Pallet Town.
*   **Rattata Level:** Wild Rattata encountered are level 2.
*   **"MAN" Stats:** The lead Pokémon, MAN, is level 7 and has the move Scratch.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Finding Pikachu:** The primary objective of finding a Pikachu has not yet been achieved. Encounters have only resulted in Rattata so far.
*   **Dialogue/Menu Navigation:** Multiple turns were spent navigating through dialogue and menu screens after receiving the Town Map. This indicates a potential bottleneck in the game's flow due to lengthy interactions.
*   **Getting stuck in Gary's House:** Multiple turns trying to exit Gary's House after speaking to Daisy.

## Strategies & Insights

*   **Button Mashing:** The current strategy relies heavily on selecting the first available move ("A" button). While effective against low-level Pokémon like Rattata, this may not be sustainable in the long run.
*   **Exploration Pattern:** The current exploration pattern involves moving randomly within the tall grass. A more structured approach might be beneficial to maximize the chances of encountering Pikachu.
*   **Healing:** Although unnecessary so far, healing options and items need to be identified for future use.
*   **Potential Bottleneck:** Lengthy Dialogue/Menu interactions appear to be inefficient with current strategy

## Next Objectives

1.  **Exit Gary's House:** Successfully navigate the remaining dialogue and exit Gary's house.
2.  **Return to Pikachu Search:** Resume exploring the overworld and entering tall grass to trigger more encounters.
3.  **Optimize Exploration:** Consider a more structured approach to exploring the tall grass to increase the likelihood of encountering a Pikachu. Perhaps focus on specific areas or use Repels if the random encounters become too frequent.
4.  **Resource Gathering:** Consider gathering items and finding a pokemon center as soon as possible.
5.  **Develop Battle Strategy:** Begin to strategize beyond "spamming the first move." This may involve learning more about MAN's moveset and considering type matchups.
