# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on turn sequence)

## Current Status

Currently, the player character is still engaged in the initial dialogue sequence with Professor Oak within his laboratory. Control of the character has not yet been established. Progress is effectively paused until the dialogue is completed.

## Recent Actions (Turns 26-35)

*   Repeatedly attempted to advance through dialogue with Professor Oak by pressing the 'A' button.
*   No other actions could be taken due to the ongoing dialogue.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Obstacle:** The primary obstacle is the unskippable, lengthy opening dialogue. This prevents the exploration of the game world.
*   **Confirmed Game State:** The game is functioning as expected, presenting the standard opening sequence with Professor Oak.
*   **Dialogue Repetition:**  The turns consist entirely of the same repeated attempts to advance the dialogue, which suggests the game requires a specific number of inputs or triggers to progress beyond the starting sequence.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Primary:** Continue pressing the 'A' button persistently to advance through the dialogue with Professor Oak and gain control of the character.
2.  **Immediate Subsequent:** Once control is gained, prioritize exploring the immediate surroundings (Professor Oak's lab) and interacting with any available objects or characters.
3.  **Following the Storyline:** After the lab, the goal should be to follow the game's narrative prompts and objectives to begin the proper game play experience. Explore the map screen and pokedex once character control is established and the game gives the player access to these features.
