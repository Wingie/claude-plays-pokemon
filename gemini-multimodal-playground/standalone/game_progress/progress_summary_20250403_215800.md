# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Report Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on provided turns)

**Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon (specifically Pikachu)

## Current Status

*   **Location:** In battle.
*   **Pokémon:** Pikachu
*   **Pikachu HP:** 14/20
*   **Opponent:** Rattata
*   **Battle State:** After using the move THUNDERSHO, we are repeatedly waiting for and advancing the dialogue boxes.

## Recent Actions

*   **Repeated Action:** Over the last 10 turns (turn_59 - turn_68), the sole action has been pressing 'A' to advance the battle dialogue after Pikachu uses THUNDERSHO. This indicates that the battle is continuing, but we are not actively making choices (selecting moves, using items, etc.).

## Key Discoveries

*   **Inefficient Automation:** The strategy is stuck in a loop of executing THUNDERSHO and advancing dialogue. This is not an efficient way to level up. It appears that either Pikachu is unable to knock out the Rattata with a single THUNDERSHO, or that post-battle dialogue is also being advanced with the same button press.
*   **Low Health:** Pikachu's HP is at 14/20, indicating sustained damage during these battles. This could potentially lead to Pikachu fainting.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Diagnose Battle Loop:** Determine *why* the battle is stuck. Is THUNDERSHO simply not powerful enough, or is Rattata healing?
2.  **Implement Dynamic Move Selection:** Move away from the fixed "THUNDERSHO" and implement logic to select the most effective move based on the opponent's type and remaining HP.  Prioritize moves that will knock out the Rattata in a single hit.
3.  **Health Management:** If Pikachu's health continues to decrease, implement a system to use Potions or Flee the battle before fainting. Prioritize preserving Pikachu over grinding.
4.  **Consider Location Change:** If Rattata are proving too difficult or grant insufficient XP, explore other areas with weaker or more easily defeated Pokémon.
5.  **Monitor Experience Gains:** Track experience points earned per battle to optimize the grinding process. Determine if Rattata are a viable source of experience or if we need to find a more efficient way to level up.
