# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** Current Date (Implied)

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest, Overworld (Coordinates initially (8, 5), now (7, 5)).
*   **Goal:** Level up Pokémon.
*   **State:** Not in battle (`is_in_battle = FALSE`).

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 20-25:** Repeatedly attempted to move "up" in Viridian Forest, but remained at the same location (8, 5). Initially misidentified previous actions of pressing "A" as correct.
*   **Turns 26-28:** Recognized being stuck in a loop at (8, 5) and re-evaluated the strategy.  Identified moving right as a possible alternative route towards tall grass where wild Pokémon are likely to be found.
*   **Turn 29:** Moved one space to the left (new coordinates (7,5)).

## Key Discoveries

*   **Location Awareness:** Correctly identified being in the overworld and not in battle.
*   **Stuck in a Loop:** Identified a repeating pattern of unsuccessful "up" movements at (8, 5).
*   **Directional Strategy:** Recognized the option to move left or right to escape the loop and seek out wild Pokémon in the tall grass.

## Challenges

*   **Navigation:** Difficulty navigating the environment, leading to being stuck in a loop.
*   **Misidentification of Input:** Previous "A" button presses were incorrectly attributed to a battle scenario, requiring a state reset.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Moving Right:** Persist in the strategy of moving right from (7, 5) to enter the tall grass.
2.  **Engage Wild Pokémon:** Once in the tall grass, actively seek out and battle wild Pokémon to gain experience and level up.
3.  **Monitor Location:** Pay close attention to coordinates to avoid getting stuck in loops again and to track progress through the forest.
