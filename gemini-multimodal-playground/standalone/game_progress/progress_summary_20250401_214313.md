# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 26-35

**Current Goal:** Explore the Pokédex and Map Screen

## Current Status

Currently, we are still trapped in the initial dialog sequence with Professor Oak within his laboratory. Progress is blocked until the dialog is completed.

## Recent Actions

*   Repeatedly pressed the "A" button in an attempt to advance through the ongoing dialog with Professor Oak. This action was consistently performed across all recent turns (26-35).

## Key Discoveries

*   **Professor Oak is verbose.** The dialog is extensive and requires continued input to progress.
*   **Input Lag/Confirmation:** It's unclear if button presses are consistently registering. The perceived lack of progress may indicate a need for more deliberate or prolonged button presses.
*   **Stuck State:** The game is effectively in a stuck state until the initial dialog concludes. This highlights the importance of fully completing tutorial and introductory sequences.

## Obstacles Faced

*   **Dialog Lock:** The primary obstacle is the inability to break free from the professor's initial conversation. This prevents any exploration or progression in the game.
*   **Potential Input Issues:** Possible issues with button registration or an extended dialog length is hampering progress.

## Strategies Attempted & Results

*   **Spamming the "A" Button:** This strategy, employed across all recent turns, has consistently failed to advance the dialog. The root cause of the delay is unknown (length of dialog, missed prompts, game lag, etc.).

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Dialog Advancement:** Persistently attempt to progress through the dialog with Professor Oak, paying close attention to any on-screen prompts or changes.
2.  **Verify Input:** Confirm that the input being registered by testing other buttons like start or select.
3.  **Troubleshooting:** If repeated attempts fail, consider restarting the game or seeking external guides/walkthroughs to ensure no crucial steps are missed during the initial sequence.
4.  **Post-Dialog Exploration:** Once the dialog is concluded, immediately begin exploring the game world, prioritizing the Pokédex and map screen to familiarize ourselves with the game's tools and environment.
