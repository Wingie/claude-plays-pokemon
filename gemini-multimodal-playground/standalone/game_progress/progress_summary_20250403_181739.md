# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld/Battle
*   **Lead Pokémon:** Pikachu
    *   HP: 11/19
    *   Status: Healthy
*   **Current Activity:** Battling a paralyzed Rattata.

## Recent Actions (Turns 15-24)

The primary objective remains leveling up Pokémon. Initial attempts to find wild encounters involved moving right into the grass. We encountered a Rattata, initiating a battle. The battle has been ongoing, with the following key actions:

*   **Turns 15-16:** Attempting to enter the grass to initiate a wild encounter.
*   **Turn 17:** Selected and used "Thundershock" against Rattata.
*   **Turns 18-19:** Awaiting battle dialog to advance.
*   **Turn 20:** Pika's ability "Static" paralyzed the wild Rattata.
*   **Turns 21-24:** Repeatedly selecting the "FIGHT" option from the battle menu.

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Location Confirmation:** We're still within Viridian Forest or an adjacent area, based on the presence of Rattata.
*   **Status Affliction Effectiveness:** Pikachu's "Static" ability inflicted paralysis on Rattata, which is a significant advantage in the current battle.
*   **Repetitive Actions:** There's a sequence of actions requiring button presses to advance through dialog boxes, which can be optimized. There appears to be an issue where the "Fight" menu needs to be selected repeatedly even though we want to continue attacking.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Finish Current Battle:** Successfully defeat the paralyzed Rattata.
2.  **Level Up Pikachu:** Continue battling wild Pokémon in the grass to gain experience points for Pikachu.
3.  **Prioritize Offensive Moves:** Continue utilizing "Thundershock" or similar offensive moves for efficient battling.
4.  **Optimize Battle Input:** Address the repetitive selection of "FIGHT" during the battle. Determine if this is a bug or requires a different strategy.
