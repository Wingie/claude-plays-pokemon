# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest

**Current Status:**

*   **Location:** Exploring Viridian Forest (specific coordinates unknown).
*   **Objective:** Find and catch a Pikachu.
*   **Pokémon:** Trainer currently has one Pokémon (Name: MAN), leveling up through wild encounters.
*   **Battle Status:** Currently not in battle.

**Recent Actions (Turns 5-14):**

Our primary activity has been engaging in wild Pokémon battles within Viridian Forest. We have primarily encountered Caterpie and Weedle. These encounters were initiated by moving randomly in tall grass, however, this approach can be changed since our team is familiar with the area.

*   **Turns 5-7:** Battled Caterpie using Scratch.
*   **Turn 8:** Defeated Caterpie, viewing the "Wild CATERPIE fainted!" message and entering the battle summary screen.
*   **Turns 9-11:** Cleared battle summary screens by repeatedly pressing "A" and resumed navigating the overworld by walking up, right, then down.
*   **Turns 12-14:** Engaged in battles with Weedle, consistently using Scratch as the primary attack.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   **Common Encounters:** Caterpie and Weedle are frequent Pokémon encounters in our current area of Viridian Forest.
*   **Effective Attack:** Scratch is proving to be a viable attack for leveling up our Pokémon against these early-game opponents.
*   **Navigation:** Random movement in tall grass leads to wild Pokémon encounters.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Pikachu Elusive:** We have yet to encounter a Pikachu despite our continued exploration.
*   **Repetitive Battles:** Battling the same Pokémon species repeatedly can be time-consuming and offer diminishing returns in terms of experience.
*   **Lack of Information:** No information of the health of our pokemon or any items, making it harder to play optimally

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Prioritize Pikachu Search:** Modify movement pattern to better explore the area, maybe by going through the map once row by row.
2.  **Continue Leveling:** Level up our pokemon by continuing to engage in wild pokemon battles.
3.  **Monitor Resources:** Pay attention to the Pokemon's health
