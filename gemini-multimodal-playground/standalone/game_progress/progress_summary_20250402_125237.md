# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

*   Currently engaged in a battle.
*   Located in the Overworld near tall grass and trees, on a path going upwards. Coordinates have consistently been (2, 11).

## Recent Actions (Turns 75-84)

*   **Exploration Attempts:** Repeatedly attempted to move upwards into the tall grass to trigger battles (Turns 75-79, 81). This resulted in remaining at the same location (2, 11) for several turns, suggesting a potential obstacle or the need for more varied exploration.
*   **Directional Change:** Recognized a loop and attempted to break free by moving left into the tall grass (Turn 80).
*   **Battle Engagement:** Successfully entered a battle (Turn 82).
*   **Combat Strategy:** Consistently opted for the first available attack option, presumably the strongest (Turns 82-84).

## Key Discoveries

*   **Location Awareness:** The game reports coordinates, allowing us to track movement (or lack thereof).
*   **Battle Trigger:** Tall grass appears to be the primary location for encountering wild Pokémon and initiating battles.
*   **Combat Mechanics:**  The game indicates the presence of attack options, with the first option assumed to be the strongest.
*   **Repetitive Actions:** Repeatedly attempting the same action (moving up) in the same location did not consistently trigger battles, suggesting the need for varied approaches to exploration.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Win Current Battle:** Focus on defeating the opponent in the current battle using the chosen combat strategy (first attack option).
2.  **Evaluate Battle Outcome:** After the battle, assess the effectiveness of the chosen attack and any experience gained.
3.  **Strategic Exploration:** Upon exiting the battle, avoid repeating the loop. Explore different directions (left, right, down) and areas beyond the immediate vicinity of coordinates (2, 11).
4.  **Vary Movement:** Experiment with different movement patterns (e.g., zig-zagging) within the tall grass to increase the likelihood of encountering new Pokémon.
5.  **Observe Environment:** Pay closer attention to the surrounding environment for any clues or paths that might lead to more diverse encounters or objectives.

## Insights

*   The game seems to be designed to encourage exploration and experimentation.  Simply repeating the same action may not always yield the desired results.
*   Strategic movement within the tall grass is crucial for triggering battles.
*   The first attack option is being treated as the "strongest" for now.  Further observation and battle analysis are needed to confirm this and potentially adapt combat strategies.
