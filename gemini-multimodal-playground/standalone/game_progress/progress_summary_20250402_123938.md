# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Route 1
*   **Objective:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.
*   **Current Activity:** Engaged in a battle with a wild RATTATA. Pidgey is using Tackle.

## Recent Actions (Turns 30-39)

*   **Exploration:** Initial attempts to move north on Route 1 resulted in a looping path. Adjusted strategy to navigate Route 1 by trying left, then up, then right.
*   **Engagement:** Encountered and initiated a battle with a wild RATTATA.
*   **Combat:** Continuously selected the first attack option (Tackle with Pidgey) during the battle.
*   **Dialogue:** Advanced through a message box encountered on Route 1.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Pathfinding Challenges:** Moving directly north on Route 1 may result in a loop, requiring exploration of alternative routes.
*   **Wild Pokémon:** Identified RATTATA as a wild Pokémon present on Route 1.
*   **Combat Basics:** Successfully initiated combat and consistently used the "Tackle" attack.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Route Navigation:** Initial challenges in navigating Route 1 due to the looping path.
*   **Monotony:** Repeatedly selecting the same attack option may lead to slow and potentially less effective battles.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Defeat RATTATA:** Continue attacking the RATTATA until it is defeated, focusing on efficient use of attacks to minimize damage taken.
2.  **Explore Route 1 More Methodically:** After the battle, systematically explore Route 1, paying attention to landmarks and potential paths to avoid looping.
3.  **Vary Combat Tactics:** Experiment with different attack options (if available) to learn about their effects and effectiveness against different Pokémon types.
4.  **Monitor Pidgey's Health:** Keep a close watch on Pidgey's health during battles and consider using items (if available) to heal if necessary.
5.  **Find More Battles:** Actively seek out additional battles to gain experience and improve combat skills.
