# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 60-69

## Current Status

*   **Primary Goal:** Level up Pokémon (currently stalled).
*   **Critical Condition:** Pikachu's HP is critically low (11/20), requiring immediate healing.
*   **Stuck in Battle Loop:** The game is currently stuck in a battle loop. We are repeatedly encountering the battle menu.
*   **Battle Status:** `battle_menu_visible = true`, `is_in_battle = true`, `needs_healing = true`.

## Recent Actions

Over the past ten turns, the consistent action has been attempting to escape battle due to Pikachu's low health. The planned sequence of actions has been:

1.  Press Down twice to select "RUN".
2.  Press A to confirm the selection.

This sequence has been executed repeatedly, but **has not been successful in escaping battle.**

## Key Discoveries & Challenges

*   **Escaping Battles Problem:** The primary challenge is the inability to successfully execute the "RUN" command. The reason for this failure is unknown, it is suspected that the "RUN" command may be failing randomly or a different input is required.
*   **Consistent Low Health:** Pikachu's low health has been a persistent problem, preventing progress towards the level-up goal. This is likely due to a series of unsuccessful battles.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Troubleshooting Escape Failure:** Identify why the "RUN" command is failing. Consider alternative strategies for escaping battle, or attempting to defeat the encountered pokemon if running is not possible.
2.  **Prioritize Healing:** Once the battle is escaped, prioritize healing Pikachu. This can be achieved by:
    *   Using a Potion or other healing item (if available in the Bag).
    *   Visiting a Pokémon Center.
3.  **Resume Leveling:** After healing, resume the original goal of leveling up Pokémon. Choose battles carefully, prioritizing weaker opponents to minimize damage and gain experience efficiently.
