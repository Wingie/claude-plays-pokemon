# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Route 2, near the entrance to Viridian Forest.
*   **Coordinates:** (7, 5)
*   **Lead Pokémon HP:** 24/24
*   **Current Activity:** In Battle with a Rattata

## II. Recent Actions & Progress

*   **Initial Confusion:** Started inside the Viridian City Pokémon Center. Initially, the 'Down' action to exit the center was repeatedly executed without updating the location, leading to a perceived loop.
*   **Successful Exit:** Eventually managed to exit the Pokémon Center and navigate to Route 2.
*   **Route 2 Encounter:** Initiated a battle on Route 2.
*   **Menu Misidentification:** Several turns were spent incorrectly identifying the game state as being "in the menu" when, in fact, the agent was in battle with a wild Pokemon.
*   **Corrected State:** The game state is now correctly identified as being "in battle."

## III. Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Viridian Forest Location:** Confirmed Viridian Forest is directly north of the current location on Route 2.
*   **State Tracking Importance:** Demonstrates the crucial need for accurate state tracking. Misidentifying the game state (menu vs. battle) severely hindered progress.
*   **Route 2 Encounters:** Route 2 contains wild Pokémon, at least Rattata. This highlights the potential for training opportunities and resource expenditure (Potions, Poké Balls) before entering Viridian Forest.

## IV. Next Objectives

1.  **Defeat/Capture Rattata:** Execute the battle strategy of 'Fight' -> 'First Move' to resolve the current encounter.
2.  **Navigate to Viridian Forest:** After the battle, move north to enter Viridian Forest.
3.  **Search for Pikachu:** Explore the tall grass within Viridian Forest to encounter a Pikachu.
4.  **Catch Pikachu:** Once a Pikachu is encountered, attempt to catch it using Poké Balls.
5.  **Monitor HP:** Closely monitor the lead Pokémon's HP and return to the Pokémon Center in Viridian City if healing is required.

## V. Challenges & Mitigation Strategies

*   **Incorrect State Tracking:** This remains a significant challenge. Implement more robust state detection mechanisms based on visual cues and game responses.
*   **Potential Resource Depletion:** Battling wild Pokémon on Route 2 might deplete resources (HP, PP, Poké Balls). Monitor resource levels and adjust the strategy accordingly (e.g., avoid unnecessary battles).
