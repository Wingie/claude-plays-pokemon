# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Route Unknown (Based on encounter type)
*   **Active Pokémon:** Mankey
*   **Current Goal:** Level up Mankey through battles.
*   **Opponent:** Facing primarily Rattata encounters.

## Recent Actions (Turns 15-24)

The primary activity for the last several turns has been engaging in a series of battles against Rattata in an effort to level up Mankey. The strategy employed has consistently been to use Mankey's first attack option, "Fight/Scratch," against these Rattata.

## Key Discoveries & Observations

*   **Enemy Prevalence:** Rattata are proving to be a very common encounter in the current area.
*   **Mankey's Effectiveness:** While details on how effective the move Fight/Scratch is against Rattata is not known (yet), the strategy seems viable as the battles are continuing, implying damage is being dealt.
*   **Battle Duration:** Battles against Rattata appear to be lasting multiple turns, suggesting they may have more HP than anticipated or the selected move is not super effective.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Repetitive Encounters:** The repeated Rattata encounters may become tedious.
*   **Limited Information:** We currently lack details on damage output and effectiveness of Mankey's moves.
*   **Leveling Pace:** Leveling Mankey may be slower than desired given the number of battles.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Grinding:** Persist in battling Rattata until Mankey gains a level or shows significant improvement.
2.  **Evaluate Move Effectiveness:** After the next battle, compare Mankey's stats with Rattata's and find more efficient moves.
3. **Explore:** Once Mankey has gained a level, look to move to another area or route.
4. **Item Usage:** Investigate possible item usage that can help to grow MANKEY, such as EXP share.

## Strategic Considerations

*   **Move Optimization:** If available, look for better moves for Mankey.
*   **Location Change:** If the Rattata encounters become too inefficient for leveling, consider exploring adjacent routes to diversify encounters and potentially find weaker Pokémon for faster leveling.
*   **Item Management:** Utilize any available healing items to sustain Mankey through the grinding process.
