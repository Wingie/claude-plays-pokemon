# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Gameplay Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on "recent turns" context)

**Overall Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, near tall grass.
*   **Party Leader HP:** 12/21 HP (Low - Requires Healing)
*   **Battle Status:** Not currently in battle.

## Recent Actions (Turns 85-94)

*   Engaged in battle with a wild Pidgey.
*   Repeatedly selected "FIGHT" and the first available move.
*   Successfully defeated the wild Pidgey.
*   Gained 15 EXP. Points from the battle.
*   Exited battle and returned to the overworld within tall grass.
*   Initially misjudged the need for healing based on HP percentage.
*   Corrected assessment of HP and determined a need to visit the Pokémon Center for healing.
*   Began moving towards the Pokémon Center.

## Key Discoveries

*   Confirmed the basic battle mechanics: select "FIGHT" and a move to attack.
*   Recognized the EXP gain mechanic after defeating an opponent.
*   Developed a better understanding of when healing is necessary, defining a low-HP threshold (below 30% of Max HP)

## Obstacles Faced

*   **Low HP:** Our lead Pokémon's health is critically low, requiring immediate healing to prevent fainting in future encounters.
*   **Initial Misjudgment of HP:** An initial error in HP assessment wasted a turn.

## Strategies Employed

*   **Offensive Focus:** The primary strategy involved consistently selecting "FIGHT" and using the first available move. This strategy, while simplistic, successfully defeated the Pidgey.
*   **Healing Prioritization (Delayed):** Initially, the need for healing was underappreciated. This was later corrected, and the strategy shifted to prioritizing a trip to the Pokemon Center.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Reach the Pokémon Center:** Navigate to the nearest Pokémon Center to fully restore the party leader's HP.
2.  **Heal Pokémon:** Utilize the Pokémon Center's services to heal the party leader's HP to full.
3.  **Resume Battle Search:** Once healed, return to the tall grass and continue searching for and engaging in Pokémon battles.
4.  **Explore Alternative Battle Strategies:** As we progress, consider exploring more strategic battle options beyond simply using the first move. This may involve learning about type matchups, status effects, and move prioritization.
