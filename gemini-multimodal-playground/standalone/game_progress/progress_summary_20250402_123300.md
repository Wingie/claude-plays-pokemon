# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 65 - 74

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

*   We are actively engaging in battles to gain experience and learn combat strategies.
*   We have successfully won at least one battle.
*   Our Pokémon has gained experience points.

## Recent Actions

*   **Focus:** Repeatedly engaged in battles with wild RATTATA.
*   **Action:** Primarily used the "Attack" command.
*   **Outcome:** Successfully defeated a RATTATA in at least one encounter.
*   **Reward:** Gained 24 experience points for our Pokémon.

## Key Discoveries

*   **RATTATA Encounters:** RATTATA are a common wild Pokémon in the current location, providing readily available battle opportunities.
*   **Experience Gain:** Defeating Pokémon grants experience points, contributing to our Pokémon's growth.
*   **Basic Combat:** We are utilizing the basic attack command to engage and defeat wild Pokémon.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Repetitive Battles:** The consistent focus on RATTATA battles indicates a lack of variety in encountered Pokémon. This could lead to slow progression and limited learning opportunities regarding different types and strategies.

## Next Objectives

*   **Vary Encounters:** Explore different areas or methods to encounter a wider variety of Pokémon, allowing for a more diverse combat experience.
