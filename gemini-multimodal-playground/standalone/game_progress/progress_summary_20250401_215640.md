# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Navigate to the Viridian City Poké Mart (identified by its blue roof).

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently engaged in a battle.
*   **Party:**  Charamander (18/27 HP) is the active Pokémon.
*   **Objective Status:** The player is struggling to navigate the battle menus and select Charamander to continue fighting.
*   **Inventory:** Status unknown.
*   **Progress towards Goal:** The player is not actively progressing towards Viridian City due to being stuck in a battle menu loop.

## Recent Actions (Turns 75-84)

The primary activity during these turns has been an ongoing battle.  The player's actions have been heavily focused on trying to select Charamander to continue the fight.  However, there appears to be confusion with navigating the Pokémon information screen and/or the "Choose Pokémon or CANCEL" screen within the battle. Repeatedly, the player finds themselves on the Charamander information screen and attempts to exit it with 'B'. They then try to re-select Charamander using 'A' from the menu, only to find themselves back on the information screen. The player also tried selecting the Summary option, perhaps hoping that would select Charamander.

**Key events:**

*   Repeatedly entering and exiting Charamander's information screen.
*   Difficulty in selecting Charamander from the "Choose Pokémon" menu.
*   Attempting to select the Summary option to continue the battle (incorrect assumption).

## Key Discoveries / Insights

*   **Menu Navigation Challenge:** The player is encountering a significant problem with menu navigation within battles, specifically regarding selecting the active Pokémon after viewing its information. This suggests a misunderstanding of the battle flow or potentially a control mapping issue.
*   **Incorrect Selection Strategy:** The player believes the way to select Charamander involves selecting the summary option.
*   **Persistence:** Despite being stuck, the player persistently tries different methods to continue the battle.

## Obstacles Faced

*   **Confusing Battle Menu Navigation:** The primary obstacle is the difficulty in navigating the Pokémon selection menu during battles. This is preventing the player from using Charamander's moves and defeating the opponent.
*   **Misunderstanding of Game Mechanics:** The player's belief that selecting "SUMMARY" will continue the battle indicates a misunderstanding of how to properly choose the Pokémon to fight.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Resolve Battle Menu Confusion:** The immediate priority is to break out of the current menu loop and successfully select Charamander to continue the battle. The player should confirm if they can select the FIGHT option again, or if they need to select the Charamander icon displayed on the screen when prompted with the "Choose Pokémon or CANCEL" screen to continue fighting. The most likely correct choice involves exiting the Pokémon summary, then selecting the pokemon in the choose pokemon menu (the A button is likely to work).
2.  **Complete the Battle:** After resolving the menu issue, focus on defeating the current opponent.
3.  **Travel North to Viridian City:** Once the battle is complete, resume the original objective of heading north to Viridian City.
4.  **Locate the Blue-Roofed Poké Mart:** Upon arrival in Viridian City, the player should actively search for the Poké Mart with the distinctive blue roof.
