# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 7-16

## Current Status

*   The player is currently exploring the overworld, primarily in areas with tall grass.
*   The primary objective remains: **find and win Pokémon battles.**
*   A wild Rattata was successfully defeated.
*   The player is currently aware of their surroundings including tall grass and small trees.

## Recent Actions

*   **Battle:** Engaged in and won a battle against a Wild Rattata (Turns 7-9). The first available attack was used.
*   **Exploration:**  Repeatedly moved "up" through tall grass to explore (Turns 10-15). Realized this may be a looping area and switched to moving right (Turn 16).
*   **Leveling:** Man (presumably a Pokémon) gained 24 experience points.

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Initial Encounters:** Confirmed presence of Wild Rattata in the tall grass.
*   **Terrain:** The overworld exploration is currently confined to areas of tall grass, potentially limiting visibility and movement options.
*   **Looping Issue:** The player appears to be stuck in a loop moving "up", highlighting a potential navigation challenge.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Navigation:** Difficulty navigating the environment, leading to a perceived loop.
*   **Limited Information:** Lack of specific detail on what attack was used to defeat Rattata and which Pokémon gained EXP.

## Next Objectives

*   **Break the Loop:** Successfully navigate out of the looping area by exploring other directions (e.g., right as initiated in Turn 16).
*   **Locate New Areas:** Identify new environments beyond the initial tall grass area, potentially leading to more diverse Pokémon encounters and resources.
*   **Continue Battling:** Actively seek out and win more Pokémon battles to gain experience and potentially catch new Pokémon.
