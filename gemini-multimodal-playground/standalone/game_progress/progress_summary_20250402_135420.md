# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently in Viridian Forest, actively searching for Pikachu.
*   **Team:** Pidgey, Level 10, HP 29/29. (No other pokemon)
*   **Health:** Team is at full health, no need for immediate healing.

## II. Recent Actions & Progress

Our recent efforts have focused on navigating to and within Viridian Forest to find a Pikachu.  We started by engaging in several EXP battles with Pidgeys (Turns 0-2).  After these initial encounters, we found ourselves needing to heal and re-strategize. The sequence of actions included:

*   **Leaving Viridian Forest:** We retreated to what appeared to be the Viridian City Pokémon Center (Turn 3).
*   **Headed to the PC:** After realizing we were fully healed, we exited the PC (Turn 4)
*   **Re-entering Viridian Forest:** We successfully navigated back into Viridian Forest (Turn 5, Turn 6, Turn 7).
*   **Entering Tall Grass:** We are now actively exploring the tall grass areas within Viridian Forest where Pikachu is expected to appear.
*   **Encountered and Battled Weedle:** Initiated battles with Weedle to gain experience.

## III. Key Discoveries & Challenges

*   **Map Awareness:** We are developing better navigation skills within Viridian Forest and Viridian City, using landmarks and coordinates to guide our movements.
*   **Encounter Rate:** The encounter rate in Viridian Forest seems reasonably high, but no Pikachu has been spotted yet.
*   **Opponent Variety:** Thus far, we've encountered Pidgey and Weedle. We need to be prepared for other possible encounters.
*   **Repetitive Actions:** Several turns were spent repeating similar actions (e.g., repeatedly battling Pidgeys or attempting to enter the tall grass), highlighting potential inefficiencies in the movement or decision-making process.

## IV. Next Objectives

1.  **Pikachu Search Optimization:** Continue systematically exploring the tall grass within Viridian Forest. Consider implementing a more structured search pattern to avoid revisiting the same areas repeatedly.
2.  **Pidgey Leveling:** While searching, continue fighting and gaining experience.
3.  **Pikachu Capture Preparation:** Once a Pikachu is encountered, prepare for capture!
