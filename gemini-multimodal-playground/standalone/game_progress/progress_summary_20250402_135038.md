# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:** Exploring the area, presumably Viridian City or its surroundings, to locate and enter Viridian Forest. Still attempting to finish an ongoing battle with a Rattata.

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Recent Actions & Progress

*   **Initial Exploration (Turn 0):**  After an initial battle, the player found themselves in an overworld area, assumed to be the starting town or route near Viridian Forest. The player correctly identified the need to find tall grass for Pokémon encounters.

*   **Ongoing Battle (Turns 1, 2, 3, 4):** A significant obstacle has been an unexpectedly lengthy battle with a Rattata. Multiple turns have been dedicated to simply using Tackle (or Gust in Turn 1) to defeat the Rattata. This highlights the potential for time-consuming early-game battles.

*   **Seeking Tall Grass (Turns 2, 3, 4):** The player identified tall grass to the North and has attempted to move towards it. However, the character has also entered and explored a building (most likely the Pokemon Center), possibly inadvertently. This suggests a minor navigational challenge in finding the correct path.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Rattata Encounters:** Frequent Rattata encounters in the early game are confirmed.
*   **Pokémon Center:** Discovered a Pokémon Center, implying that the player is indeed in or near Viridian City.
*   **Northward Progression:** Tall grass, and therefore likely Viridian Forest, lies to the North of the player's starting location.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Prolonged Early Battles:** The repeated battles with the Rattata are consuming time and resources (though HP has remained full so far). It may be necessary to consider using more effective moves (if available) or strategies to expedite battles.
*   **Navigation:** Finding the exact location of Viridian Forest and the entrance to tall grass has proven slightly more complex than anticipated, potentially requiring additional exploration.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Defeat the Rattata:** Bring the ongoing battle with the Rattata to a swift conclusion. Consider alternative strategies (e.g., status moves, different Pokémon) if the battle continues to be prolonged.
2.  **Navigate to Viridian Forest:**  Prioritize reaching the tall grass located to the North. Pay close attention to landmarks and map features to ensure the correct path is followed.
3.  **Engage in Wild Encounters in Viridian Forest:** Once in the tall grass, initiate encounters with wild Pokémon in Viridian Forest.
4.  **Catch a Pikachu:** Continue battling wild Pokémon until a Pikachu is encountered. Utilize appropriate Poké Balls (Poké Ball only currently available) and battle strategies to successfully capture it.
5.  **Heal if necessary:** If the lead pokemon's health falls below 10%, navigate to the Pokemon Center to heal.
