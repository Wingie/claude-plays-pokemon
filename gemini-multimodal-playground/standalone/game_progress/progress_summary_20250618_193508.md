# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** Current Date

**Current Goal:** Level up Pikachu through wild Pokémon battles.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Stuck in battle against a fainted Caterpie.
*   **Party:**
    *   Pikachu: HP 14/20. Available moves: GROWL, THUNDERSHOCK, TAIL WHIP.
*   **Status Effects:** None.
*   **Overall:** Currently experiencing a bug where the battle is not ending properly after defeating the opponent. Pikachu's HP is not critical, but healing is needed after exiting the battle.

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 40-49)

*   Repeated attempts to advance the dialogue after defeating a wild Caterpie, but the game remains stuck on the move selection screen.
*   Each turn involved identical observations, analyses, and plans, revolving around pressing "A" to attempt exiting the glitched battle state.

## III. Key Discoveries

*   **Game-Breaking Bug:** A recurring bug is preventing proper battle completion. After defeating a Caterpie, the game fails to advance past the move selection screen.
*   **Pikachu's Move Set:** We have confirmed Pikachu knows GROWL, THUNDERSHOCK, and TAIL WHIP.
*   **HP Threshold Awareness:** Established a need to heal Pikachu when HP drops below 30% (6 HP in Pikachu's case).

## IV. Challenges Faced

*   **The Loop:** The primary challenge is the persistent battle loop. We cannot progress until this issue is resolved.
*   **Stamina Drain (Inherent):** While not immediately critical, repeated battles (even glitched ones) will eventually drain Pikachu's HP, requiring healing.

## V. Next Objectives

1.  **Escape the Battle Loop:** Find a way to exit the glitched battle state. Possible strategies (if controllable):
    *   Try running from the battle (though menus may be inaccessible).
    *   Try using an item, if inventory can be accessed.
    *   Consider any potential button combinations that might force a reset or interrupt the game's state.
2.  **Heal Pikachu:** Once out of the battle, immediately heal Pikachu at a Pokémon Center to restore its HP.
3.  **Bug Resolution:** If the glitch persists, we need to consider alternative solutions like reloading a previous save state (if available) or investigating the root cause of the bug (more difficult with limited debugging capabilities).
4.  **Resume Leveling:** Assuming the bug is resolved, return to the original goal of finding battles to level up Pikachu. Prioritize battles against Pokémon that Pikachu's THUNDERSHOCK is effective against.

## VI. Strategy Analysis

*   **Failed Strategy:** Simply pressing "A" repeatedly is not resolving the battle loop. The bug appears to be more fundamental.

## VII. Future Plans (Contingent on Bug Resolution)

*   **Route Analysis:** Once Pikachu is healed, analyze nearby routes for optimal leveling spots, considering Pokémon types and experience yields.
*   **Move Set Evaluation:** As Pikachu levels up, evaluate new moves and consider replacing less effective ones.

## VIII. Risk Assessment

*   **Data Loss:** Persistent bugs may lead to data corruption or the need to restart the game.
*   **Progress Stalling:** The current bug is significantly hindering progress.

## IX. Conclusion

The current gameplay session is severely hampered by a battle loop glitch. Resolving this bug is the top priority. Further progress on leveling Pikachu is contingent on a solution.
