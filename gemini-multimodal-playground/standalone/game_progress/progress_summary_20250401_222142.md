# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 90-99

**Current Goal:** Navigate to Viridian City and locate the Poké Mart with the blue roof.

## Current Status

*   Currently engaged in a battle against a Rattata in an unknown location.
*   Charmander (Level 9) has 18/27 HP.

## Recent Actions

*   **Struggled to navigate battle menus.** The player encountered difficulties selecting "FIGHT" and continuing the battle, repeatedly accessing Pokémon information screens and the "Choose POKéMON or CANCEL" menu. Several turns were spent trying to exit these menus, indicating confusion with the user interface.
*   **Finally managed to (presumably) get back to the battle.** After multiple attempts to exit the menus, the player is now in a position to select "FIGHT" in the battle against the Rattata.

## Key Discoveries/Challenges

*   **Menu Navigation:** The player is exhibiting clear difficulties navigating the battle menus. The frequent errors suggest a need for more deliberate and precise inputs.
*   **Repetitive Battles:** The constant engagement with Rattata suggests exploration has not been the focus. Getting caught in battles is hampering progress towards the primary goal.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Successfully execute "FIGHT" in the current battle against Rattata.** The player must now successfully select the "FIGHT" option to progress.
2.  **Win the current battle.** Victory against the Rattata is necessary to resume exploration.
3.  **Resume Navigation to Viridian City:** After the battle, the primary focus should immediately shift back to finding the Poké Mart with the blue roof in Viridian City. This requires prioritizing movement and minimizing random encounters.
4.  **Improve Menu Navigation Skills:** The player should actively focus on learning the battle menu layout and optimal button presses to minimize future errors and wasted turns.
