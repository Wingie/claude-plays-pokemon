# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Reach Viridian City and find the blue-roofed Poké Mart.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently in the overworld, repeatedly encountering a sign north of position (5, 9). Occasionally engaged in wild Pokémon battles.
*   **Party:**
    *   Charmander: Level 9, 18/27 HP. Knows Scratch.
*   **Progress Blocked By:** Navigating around a sign obstructing the path to Viridian City.

## Recent Actions (Turns 35-44)

*   **Navigational Attempts (Turns 35-39):**  Repeatedly attempted to bypass a sign blocking the northern path using the "Right, Up, Left" maneuver.  The opposite maneuver, "Left, Up, Right," was also attempted in previous turns. These attempts have consistently failed, suggesting a flawed strategy or unforeseen game mechanics.
*   **Wild Pidgey Encounters (Turns 40-44):**  Engaged in several battles with wild Pidgey.
    *   Turn 40: Initial instinct was to flee the battle to reach Viridian City quickly.
    *   Turns 41-44: Shifted strategy to fight the Pidgey using Charmander's Scratch attack. Prioritized defeating the Pidgey rather than escaping, despite the objective of reaching Viridian City.

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Navigation Challenges:**  The terrain around position (5,9) is proving difficult to navigate. Simple movements may not be sufficient to bypass the sign. There might be additional obstacles or specific movement requirements.
*   **Resource Management:** Charmander's HP is being depleted during encounters.  Healing items will likely be necessary to continue battling effectively.
*   **Prioritization Issue:** The current AI has been oscillating between prioritizing reaching Viridian City and battling wild Pokémon, highlighting a need for improved decision-making when these objectives conflict. The initial instinct to escape battles makes sense in the short term, but fighting and gaining experience may ultimately be more efficient.
*   **Looping behavior:** The current algorithm is stuck in a loop, repeatedly trying the same failed maneuver to navigate around the sign.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Re-evaluate Navigation Strategy:** Abandon the current "Right, Up, Left" and "Left, Up, Right" approach to navigating around the sign. Explore alternative routes, possibly involving more complex movement patterns or diagonal movement if possible. Look for clues in the surrounding environment. A more systematic approach is needed rather than repeating the same failed actions.
2.  **Confirm Location:**  Double-check the accuracy of the position coordinates. Misreading the position could be leading to incorrect navigation.
3.  **Assess Charmander's Condition:** Monitor Charmander's HP and consider avoiding unnecessary battles to conserve resources until reaching Viridian City.
4.  **Viridian City Exploration:** Once in Viridian City, prioritize finding the blue-roofed Poké Mart.
