# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Report Date:** Current Date

**Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon

## Current Status

*   Pikachu is currently our active Pokémon.
*   Pikachu's health is critically low (11/20 HP).

## Recent Actions (Turns 90-99)

*   Repeated attempts to run from battles due to Pikachu's low health.
*   Specifically, the action performed in each turn was:
    1.  Select "RUN" by pressing Down twice.
    2.  Confirm the selection by pressing A.

## Key Discoveries

*   Confirmed that Pikachu consistently enters battles with low health.
*   The game continues to place us into battles despite Pikachu's critical health.
*   Running appears to be a recurring necessity.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Low Pokémon Health:** Pikachu's persistent low health is preventing effective leveling.
*   **Encounter Rate:** Frequent wild Pokémon encounters exacerbate the health problem.
*   **Inability to Heal:** No indication of any actions taken to heal Pikachu.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Prioritize Healing:** The absolute first priority is to heal Pikachu. We need to identify the closest Pokémon Center or utilize healing items (Potions).
2.  **Acquire Healing Items:** If no Pokémon Center is immediately accessible, focus on purchasing Potions or other healing items.
3.  **Evaluate Team:** Assess the current Pokémon team composition and levels. Consider switching to a healthier Pokémon if available.
4.  **Safe Leveling:** Once Pikachu (or another Pokémon) is healed, find a low-risk area to begin leveling up. This might involve battling weaker Pokémon or carefully selecting encounters.
5.  **Avoid Unnecessary Battles:** While leveling, avoid unnecessary encounters to conserve resources and prevent further health depletion.

## Notes and Insights

*   The constant need to run suggests a systemic issue. Pikachu might be under-leveled for the current game area, or taking on encounters that are too difficult.
*   Future strategies should incorporate proactive healing before engaging in battles.
*   Exploration of the game world is currently hampered by the urgent need for healing and leveling.
