# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** 2023-10-27

**Current Goal:** Locate the blue-roofed Poké Mart in Viridian City.

## Current Status

Currently, we are still in Professor Oak's lab, seemingly stuck in an initial dialogue sequence. We have yet to gain full control of our character and explore freely. Progress is blocked by this ongoing dialogue. We also accidentally opened the OPTIONS menu multiple times.

## Recent Actions

*   Attempted to access the Pokedex and map via the start menu (Turn 1).
*   Accidentally opened the OPTIONS menu multiple times (Turns 2, 3, 4, 5).
*   Repeatedly pressed 'A' in an attempt to advance through the initial dialogue with Professor Oak (Turns 34, 35).

## Key Discoveries (or Lack Thereof)

*   We have confirmed that the Pokedex is an option in the game's menu.
*   We have identified that 'B' is used to exit the OPTIONS menu.
*   We are currently unable to interact with the world beyond the initial dialogue sequence.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Dialogue Lock:** We are currently stuck in the initial dialogue with Professor Oak, preventing further exploration.
*   **Menu Navigation Errors:** We have repeatedly and unintentionally opened the OPTIONS menu, indicating a need for greater care when navigating menus.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Break Free from Dialogue:** Continue pressing 'A' to advance through the dialogue with Professor Oak and finally gain control of the character.
2.  **Explore the Lab:** Once in control, examine the lab for any items or clues we might have missed.
3.  **Leave the Lab:** Exit the lab and begin our journey towards Viridian City.
4.  **Navigate to Viridian City:** Head north, following the road, until we reach Viridian City.
5.  **Find the Poké Mart:** Once in Viridian City, locate the Poké Mart with the blue roof.

## Insights and Strategies

*   **Dialogue Strategy:** The game likely forces the player to go through all dialogue options before gaining control. Repetitive pressing of the 'A' button should eventually work.
*   **Menu Awareness:** We need to be more mindful of the button presses to avoid accidentally opening the OPTIONS menu.
*   **Long-Term Strategy:** Once we reach Viridian City, we can purchase essential items and prepare for future battles and exploration.
