# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turn 12 - Turn 29

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian City and learn how to catch Pokémon.

## I. Current Status

We are currently in Viridian City, having just completed a tutorial on how to catch Pokémon. We are now free to explore the tall grass surrounding the city in order to catch wild Pokémon.

## II. Recent Actions

*   **Turns 12-25:** We were stuck in a conversation loop, repeatedly pressing the 'A' button to advance the dialogue. This appears to be part of a tutorial sequence on how to catch Pokémon. A Weedle was successfully caught during this tutorial, although the exact turn of the capture is difficult to pinpoint (likely Turn 20).
*   **Turn 26:** We emerged from the tutorial and are now able to explore the tall grass. The in-game objective reminder indicates our goal: explore Viridian City and learn how to catch Pokémon.
*   **Turn 29:** Initiated exploration of the tall grass by moving upwards. This is in pursuit of encountering a wild Pokémon to catch.

## III. Key Discoveries

*   **Pokémon Catching Tutorial:** We successfully completed a tutorial demonstrating the mechanics of catching Pokémon.
*   **Weedle Acquisition:** We caught a Weedle as part of the tutorial. This is our first Pokémon!
*   **Tall Grass Encounters:** The tall grass is confirmed as the primary location for encountering wild Pokémon.
*   **Free Exploration:** We are now free to explore Viridian City and the surrounding area.

## IV. Challenges Faced
