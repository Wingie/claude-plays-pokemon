# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 30-39

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, surrounded by tall grass and trees.
*   **Party Leader:** Pidgey, Level 6.
*   **Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Recent Actions

*   Engaged in multiple battles with wild RATTATA.
*   Primarily used Pidgey's Tackle attack.
*   Pidgey gained experience points and leveled up to Level 6.
*   Observed Pidgey's defense stat increase.

## Key Discoveries

*   Tall grass triggers wild Pokémon encounters.
*   Wild RATTATA are common encounters in the current area.
*   Winning battles grants experience points, leading to level ups and stat increases.
*   Pidgey's "Tackle" attack is effective against RATTATA.

## Challenges

*   The gameplay loop currently consists of repeatedly battling the same Pokémon (RATTATA).
*   The lack of strategic variety in battles (spamming "Tackle") may become less effective against stronger Pokémon.
*   The need to continuously press 'A' to advance through level up messages is slightly tedious.

## Next Objectives

*   Continue exploring the tall grass area to find more battles.
*   Identify opportunities to learn new strategies and possibly diversify attacks.
*   Observe Pidgey's stat growth at level 6.
*   Potentially consider catching other Pokemon to build a balanced team.
