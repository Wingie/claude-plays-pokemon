# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest

**Current Status:**

*   Location: Viridian Forest
*   Objective: Find and catch a Pikachu
*   Party Condition: Lead Pokémon (Pidgey) needs healing (22/31 HP)

**Recent Actions (Turns 70-79):**

The last ten turns have been focused on navigating Viridian Forest while battling wild Pokémon and attempting to reach the Viridian City Pokémon Center for healing.

*   **Initial Assessment (Turn 70):** The AI recognized the need for healing and planned a path to Viridian City PC: Down, Down, Left.
*   **Encountered Obstacles (Turns 71-75):** The initial movement plan was interrupted by repeated encounters with Weedle. The AI consistently chose to use Tackle, the first available move.
*   **Battle Resolution (Turn 76-77):** The Weedle battle was eventually won. The AI correctly identified and executed the action to clear the battle summary screens.
*   **Continued Movement (Turn 78-79):** After the battle, the AI returned to the objective of reaching the Pokémon Center, taking steps to get out of the tall grass and towards the south exit of Viridian Forest. A more detailed path to the Pokémon Center was planned: Down, Down, Right, Right, Down, Down.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   **High Encounter Rate:** Wild Pokémon encounters in Viridian Forest are frequent, making direct travel difficult.
*   **Weedle Predominance:** Weedle appears to be a very common Pokémon in the area.
*   **Tackle Effectiveness:** While not explicitly stated, the repeated use of Tackle suggests it's either the only available move or considered the best option in the early game.

**Challenges:**

*   **Low HP:** The lead Pokémon's low HP significantly limits exploration capabilities. Constant battles risk a blackout.
*   **Navigation:** Avoiding tall grass to minimize encounters would be ideal, but direct routes to the Pokémon Center may require passing through it.
*   **Finding Pikachu:** Pikachu has not been encountered yet, suggesting it may be rare or in a specific area of the forest.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Reach Viridian City Pokémon Center:** Continue executing the planned movement sequence (Down, Down, Right, Right, Down, Down) to reach the Pokémon Center and fully heal the party.
2.  **Re-enter Viridian Forest (if necessary):** After healing, return to Viridian Forest to resume the search for Pikachu.
3.  **Explore Alternative Strategies:** If encountering too many Weedle, consider exploring other areas of the forest or switching to a different Pokémon with more HP if available.
4.  **Consider Item Use:** If potions are available, consider using them to heal the lead Pokémon in the field to avoid unnecessary trips back to Viridian City.
