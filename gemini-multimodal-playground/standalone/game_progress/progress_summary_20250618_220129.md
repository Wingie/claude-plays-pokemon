# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest (Coordinates: 7, 5)
*   **State:** In battle with a Weedle.
*   **Party Status:** Lead Pokémon's HP is unknown. Piogeon is poisoned and needs switching out.
*   **Healing Status:** Not currently needing healing.
*   **Battle Menu Status:** Currently stuck in the Pokémon selection menu due to a poisoned Pokemon. We have not yet reached the move selection menu.

## Recent Actions and Analysis (Turns 20-29)

The last ten turns have been characterized by repetitive actions and a lack of progress due to a state issue within the game.

*   **Turns 20-24:**  The game was stuck in a dialog state at the start of a battle against a Weedle. The consistent analysis recognized the need to advance the dialog by pressing 'A', but the action failed to result in a state change.
*   **Turns 25-29:**  After finally exiting the dialog state, we are now stuck in the Pokemon selection menu. Piogeon, our lead Pokemon, has been poisoned.  The plan has been to switch Piogeon with Charmander (healthy), but the attempts to switch haven't been reflected in a game state change.

**Key Observations:**

*   **State Issue:** The game appears to be failing to transition between states correctly (Dialog to Battle Menu and Selection Menu back to Battle). We are stuck in the Pokemon selection menu, even after attempting to switch Pokemon.
*   **Environmental Factor:** We are in tall grass, which explains the frequent encounters.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Encountering Weedle:**  Viridian Forest contains wild Weedle.
*   **Poison Status Effect:** Piogeon was inflicted with the Poison status in a previous battle.

## Next Objectives

Given the current situation, the immediate objectives are:

1.  **Resolve State Issue:** Diagnose and resolve the reason the game state is not progressing correctly. If Charmander is already in battle, find a new option.
2.  **Win the Battle:** Once the state issue is resolved, select an appropriate move for Charmander to defeat Weedle.
3.  **Assess Party Health:** After the battle, confirm the status of all Pokemon in the party.
4.  **Explore Viridian Forest:** Assuming a path is available, continue exploring Viridian Forest.

**Strategy:**

*   If switching to Charmander isn't fixing the issue, we may need to consider other Pokemon or potentially even using an item (if any are available) to cure the poison status. This highlights the importance of carrying status-healing items.

**Contingency Plans:**

*   If the game remains stuck, consider restarting the game from the last save point.
*   Research common issues with FireRed/LeafGreen emulators or ROMs to identify potential causes of the state issue.
