*   **Turn 4:** Battle concluded.
*   **Turn 5:** Moved towards a building identified as a Pokémon Center. Intent was to find more battles in the tall grass, but inadvertently entered the building.
*   **Turns 6-9:** Inside the Pokémon Center. Attempts are being made to exit the Pokémon Center after Pokémon have been healed. Waiting for dialogue to complete during the healing process.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Route 1 Encounters:** Pidgey is a common encounter on Route 1.
*   **Pokémon Center Functionality:** Identified the Pokémon Center and its healing capabilities. Understand that healing is automatic.

## Analysis of Turns

The initial strategy of battling in the tall grass was successful in gaining experience for Mankey. However, accidentally entering the Pokémon Center disrupted the training process. Although, the unintentional visit has proved beneficial as it has healed any damage sustained during the training battles. The current priority is to exit the Pokémon Center and resume the original objective.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Exit Pokémon Center:** Successfully navigate out of the Pokémon Center.
2.  **Return to Route 1:** Move back into the tall grass on Route 1.
3.  **Continue Training Mankey:** Engage in more battles with wild Pokémon to further level up Mankey.
4.  **Explore Route 1:** Investigate the path to the North observed in Turn 4 for potentially stronger Pokémon or valuable items.
