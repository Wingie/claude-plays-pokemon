# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest, in tall grass.
*   **Activity:** Continuously encountering wild Pokémon battles, specifically Metapod.
*   **Lead Pokémon HP:** Relatively healthy at 26/29 HP. No immediate need for healing.
*   **Pikachu Encountered:** No Pikachu encountered yet.
*   **Poké Ball Count:** Unknown.
*   **State Tracking:** Current and previous coordinates are consistently unknown, indicating no movement between turns beyond the forced movement during battle encounters.

## Recent Actions (Turns 5-14)

The last few turns have been primarily focused on battling wild Pokémon in Viridian Forest. Our strategy initially involved selecting the "Fight" option and then the first available move. However, the program got stuck in a loop. To address this, we attempted to select "Gust" (the third move) after noticing a pattern. The battle strategy involved the following button sequence: `A`, `down`, `down`, `A`.

The plan to select "Gust" after using "fight" has been repeated and will need to be reviewed to determine if the plan is being properly executed.

## Key Discoveries and Challenges

*   **Dominant Pokémon:** Metapod is a frequent encounter in Viridian Forest.
*   **Bug in Battle Strategy:** The initial battle strategy got stuck, repeatedly selecting the first move. An attempt to correct this by selecting "Gust" has also been repeated without success.
*   **Navigation Challenges:** The coordinates remain unknown, so location within Viridian Forest is also unknown.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Debugging Battle Strategy:** Identify why the "Gust" selection is being repeated. Possible causes include incorrect button sequences, menu navigation errors, or the battle ending before the sequence completes.
2.  **Continue Pikachu Search:** Persist in exploring Viridian Forest by battling wild Pokémon. Prioritize tall grass areas.
3.  **Monitor HP:** Closely monitor lead Pokémon's HP and retreat to the Viridian City PC for healing if necessary.
4.  **Poké Ball Inventory:** We need to determine the number of Poké Balls we currently have to ensure we can catch Pikachu when we find it. Consider buying more in Viridian City if the supply is low.

## Insights and Considerations

*   Viridian Forest is proving to be heavily populated with Metapod. We may need to consider using a different strategy if "Gust" does not lead to the end of battles, or if it is ineffective against Metapod.
*   The repeated battle strategy likely means that no progress towards the main goal is occurring.
*   The lack of coordinate tracking makes it difficult to assess exploration progress. If possible, debugging should address this issue.
