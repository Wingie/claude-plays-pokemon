# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

The player is currently navigating Route 1, primarily focused on engaging in battles with wild Pokémon. The player has had at least one victory against a Pidgey. They are actively searching for more encounters within the tall grass.

## Recent Actions

*   **Exploration:** Repeatedly traversed the tall grass on Route 1 to trigger Pokémon encounters.
*   **Battles:** Engaged in multiple battles. Faced at least one Rattata and one Pidgey.
*   **Combat Strategy:** Primarily used the first available move in battle.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Wild Pokémon Encounters:** Tall grass is confirmed to be a reliable location for triggering encounters with wild Pokémon like Pidgey and Rattata on Route 1.
*   **Experience Gain:** Pidgey gained experience points (24 EXP) from a battle.
*   **Overworld Navigation:** The player is able to move through the overworld and re-enter tall grass after battles.

## Challenges

*   **Repetitive Actions:**  Turns are heavily focused on repeating the same move in battle.
*   **Limited Strategy:**  The player has been selecting the first move during combat without apparent strategic variation. This might lead to inefficiency in future, tougher battles.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Wild Pokémon Battles:** Maintain the current strategy of exploring tall grass to trigger more encounters on Route 1.
2.  **Evaluate Battle Strategy:** Consider diversifying combat moves beyond the first available option to improve battle efficiency. Start identifying different move types and their effectiveness against various Pokémon.
3.  **Resource Management (Future):** As the game progresses, consider the necessity of using or purchasing items.
