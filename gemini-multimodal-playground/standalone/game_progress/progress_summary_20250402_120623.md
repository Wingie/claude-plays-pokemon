# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up Mankey through battles.

## I. Current Status

We are currently navigating Route 1, focused on engaging in battles to train Mankey. We are experiencing some user error regarding battle inputs.

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 5-14)

*   **Engaged in Multiple Battles with Weedle:** Turns 5-14 were primarily focused on battling Weedle encounters on Route 1. The plan was to use Mankey's "Scratch" attack to defeat the Weedle and gain experience.
*   **Accidental Bag Opening and Ball Usage:** During turn 11, the bag was accidentally opened during a battle. On turn 12 a POKE BALL was accidentally thrown. This interrupted the training flow.
*   **Accidental Capture of Weedle:** Despite the intention to train Mankey, a Weedle was accidentally caught in battles on turn 13 and 14.
*   **Corrected Course:** The player recognized the errors in controls and attempted to return to the initial goal of leveling up mankey.

## III. Key Discoveries & Challenges

*   **Route 1 Encounters:** Weedle appears to be a very common encounter on Route 1.
*   **Control Issues:** The player is struggling with the controls, leading to accidental bag openings and Poké Ball throws.
*   **Lack of Focus:** The player has been deviating from the primary goal of training Mankey.

## IV. Next Objectives

*   **Prioritize Mankey Training:** Refocus on the primary objective of training Mankey through battles.
*   **Improve Battle Input Accuracy:** Take deliberate actions and carefully select "FIGHT" and "SCRATCH" during battles to avoid further mistakes with the bag menu.
*   **Continue Route 1 Exploration:** After a few more battles to gain experience, continue progressing up Route 1, seeking new encounters and potential training opportunities.
*   **Avoid Accidental Catches:** Consciously avoid opening the bag during battles to prevent unnecessary captures.
