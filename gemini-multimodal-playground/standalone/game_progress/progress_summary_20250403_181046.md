# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** 2023-10-27

**Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Wild Area (indicated by frequent Caterpie battles)
*   **Team:**
    *   Pikachu: Level 5, HP 19/19
        *   Moves: Growl, Thundershock

## Recent Actions (Turns 5-14)

The primary activity in the recent turns has been battling Caterpie repeatedly. In each encounter, the following steps were taken:

1.  **Encountered:** Wild Caterpie (Level 4)
2.  **Analyzed:** Identified Caterpie as a Bug-type Pokémon vulnerable to Electric-type attacks.
3.  **Action:** Consistently used Thundershock against Caterpie.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Thundershock Effectiveness:** Thundershock is a super effective move against Caterpie, leading to quick victories.
*   **Caterpie Prevalence:** Caterpie are a common encounter in the current area. This makes the location suitable for the current levelling goal.
*   **Move Optimization:** Growl is available but less efficient for the current levelling strategy.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Repetitive Battles:** Battling the same Pokémon repeatedly can be monotonous, but effective for early-game leveling.
*   **Move Pool Limitation:** Pikachu's movepool is currently limited to Growl and Thundershock.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Leveling Pikachu:** Keep battling Caterpie (and other wild Pokémon) until Pikachu reaches a higher level, preferably around level 8-10.
2.  **Explore Other Areas:** After gaining a few levels, consider exploring other areas to discover new Pokémon and training opportunities.
3.  **Learn New Moves:** Seek opportunities to teach Pikachu new and more powerful moves to diversify its combat abilities.
