# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Expedition

**Current Status:**

*   **Location:** Viridian City PC (Coordinates: 7, 5)
*   **Objective:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.
*   **Party Condition:** Unknown (Assuming healthy)
*   **Poké Balls:** Unknown
*   **Challenges:** Initial directional uncertainty.
*   **Progress:** Successfully located Viridian City PC.

**Recent Actions (Turns 0-9):**

The initial turns were characterized by uncertainty about our location. We started exploring, however we accidentally opened the Menu at one point and needed to exit it.
Through a series of movements, we eventually determined we are inside the Viridian City Pokémon Center (PC).  The turns (6,7,9) were essentially duplicates of turn 8, indicating no change in state despite intended actions.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Confirmed location within the Viridian City Pokémon Center.
*   Gained coordinate awareness.

**Obstacles Faced:**

*   **Directional Uncertainty:** Starting without a known location hampered initial progress.
*   **Accidental Menu Activation:** Wasted a turn due to accidental menu activation.
*   **Repetitive Turns:** Turns 6,7, and 9 didn't result in state changes, implying either a problem in the action execution or an issue with the environment not allowing movement.

**Strategies and Performance:**

*   **Exploratory Movement:** Initial random movements proved ineffective.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Recognizing the Pokémon Center environment allowed for a targeted exit strategy.
* **Exit Strategy Implementation Problems:** We keep trying to move out of the Pokemon center, but the state keeps getting reset

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Exit the Pokémon Center:** Execute a "Down" movement to leave the PC.
2.  **Navigate to Viridian Forest (Tall Grass):** After exiting, move Right to reach the tall grass. If a single "Down" is not sufficient to exit the Pokemon Center, identify the correct sequence to leave.
3.  **Explore Viridian Forest:** Enter the tall grass and begin encountering Pokémon.
4.  **Acquire Poké Balls:** If we do not already have any, we should either buy them at the Mart or attempt to find some in the overworld.
5.  **Catch a Pikachu:** The primary goal is to encounter and catch a Pikachu within Viridian Forest.

**Revised Strategy (Based on Repetitive Turns):**

Given the repetitive turns within the Pokémon Center, we need to re-evaluate our exit strategy.

1.  **Precise Exit Sequence:** Instead of a single "Down," determine the *exact* sequence of button presses needed to exit the PC from coordinates (7,5).
2.  **Post-Exit Navigation:** Once outside, resume moving Right to reach the forest.

This refined approach should break the loop and allow us to progress towards our goal.
