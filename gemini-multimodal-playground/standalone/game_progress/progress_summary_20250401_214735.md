# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** Current Date (Replace with actual date)

**Game:** Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen

**Objective:** Explore the Pokedex and Map Screen, Eventually Reach Viridian City

## Current Status

*   Currently located inside Professor Oak's lab in Pallet Town.
*   Trapped in initial dialogue sequence with Professor Oak.
*   Pokedex and Map screen exploration is currently blocked.
*   Accidentally accessed the OPTIONS menu multiple times.

## Recent Actions

*   Multiple attempts to access the main menu via the 'start' button (unsuccessful).
*   Repeatedly pressed the 'A' button to advance dialogue with Professor Oak.
*   Accidentally opened the OPTIONS menu multiple times.
*   Repeatedly pressed the 'B' button to exit the OPTIONS menu.

## Key Discoveries (or Lack Thereof)

*   **Obstacle:** Protracted dialogue sequence prevents exploration of the menu and environment.
*   **Obstacle:** Accidental activation of the OPTIONS menu is disrupting progress.
*   **Insight:** The game heavily relies on dialogue for initial progression.
*   **Insight:** There are menu items accessible and the game can be paused with the start button

## Next Objectives

1.  **Primary Objective:** Persist through the dialogue with Professor Oak by repeatedly pressing 'A' until control of the character is gained.
2.  **Secondary Objective:** Once control is regained, immediately attempt to access the main menu (using 'Start') to explore the Pokedex and map screen.
3.  **Mitigation:** Pay close attention to button presses to avoid accidentally opening the OPTIONS menu. Consider mapping controls or practicing button presses to improve accuracy.
4.  **Long Term:** Once control and access to the menu system is available, begin planning our journey to Viridian City.
