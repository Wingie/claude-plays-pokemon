# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen - Viridian Forest Exploration Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Deep within Viridian Forest. Coordinates are currently unknown.
*   **Combat State:** Currently engaged in a wild Pokémon battle.
*   **Lead Pokémon:** Unknown - Full HP (24/24), not needing healing
*   **Opponent:** Repeatedly encountering Kakuna.
*   **Resources:** Number of Pokéballs is unknown.
*   **Objective Status:** Still searching for Pikachu.

## Recent Actions (Turns 10-19)

Over the last ten turns, the primary action has been battling.  Each turn has resulted in encountering and battling a Kakuna. The strategy implemented has consistently been to select "Fight" and use the first available move. We are therefore able to continously battle, we have not been able to clear out the battle summary, so we can not escape the kakunas.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Kakuna Abundance:** Kakuna appears to be a very common encounter in Viridian Forest. The frequency of Kakuna battles suggests a possible high spawn rate for this Pokémon in the current area.
*   **No Pikachu Encounter:** Despite extensive exploration (represented by multiple battles), Pikachu has not yet been encountered. This could suggest lower spawn rates for Pikachu, requiring more patience and potentially strategic exploration.
*   **Battle loop**: The battles are automatically being engaged and not cleared by any further actions

## Challenges Faced

*   **Pikachu Elusive:**  Finding a Pikachu is proving to be challenging. The encounter rate for Pikachu seems significantly lower than Kakuna.
*   **Repetitive Battles:** The constant Kakuna battles are consuming time and potentially resources (though HP is currently full). This creates a bottleneck in the primary objective of finding a Pikachu.
*   **Unknown resources**: The number of pokeballs is unknown

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Searching for Pikachu:** Persist in exploring the tall grass within Viridian Forest. Given the apparent rarity of Pikachu, prolonged searching is necessary.
2.  **Re-evaluate Strategy**: After numerous battles with Kakuna, it might be necessary to re-evaluate the battle strategy. If these battles are consuming too much time, consider using Repels (if available) to reduce wild Pokémon encounters temporarily.
3. **Heal between battles**: Although the lead Pokémon has full health now, it needs to heal between battles to ensure continued progress and prevent fainting.
