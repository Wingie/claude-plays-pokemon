# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

The player character is primarily exploring the overworld, specifically areas with tall grass, with the intent of encountering and battling wild Pokémon. A battle was recently initiated and won against a wild Rattata. The character appears to be still on the battle screen, awaiting player input.

## Recent Actions (Turns 5-14)

*   **Turns 5-7:** Engaged in battle with a Wild Rattata. Repeatedly selected the first available attack.
*   **Turn 8:** Wild Rattata fainted, signifying victory in the battle.
*   **Turn 9:** Confirmation that the player's Pokémon (referred to as "MAN") gained 24 EXP. points. The player is prompted to press 'A' to continue from the battle screen.
*   **Turns 10-14:** Returned to the overworld, continuing exploration of tall grass areas, attempting to find more battles. The character moved "up" in each of these turns.

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Basic Combat Mechanics:** The player understands the basic combat mechanic of selecting an attack during battle.
*   **Experience Points:** The player successfully gained experience points for their Pokémon after winning a battle.
*   **Overworld Exploration:** The player is actively exploring tall grass areas known to harbor wild Pokémon, indicating an understanding of encounter mechanics.
*   **Rattata Encounter Frequency:** The player has encountered at least one Rattata. This suggests Rattata might be a common Pokémon in the current area.

## Challenges & Obstacles

*   **Repetitive Exploration:** The player seems to be stuck in a loop of moving "up" in tall grass, suggesting a possible lack of direction or an inefficient exploration strategy.
*   **Limited Information:** The report only refers to "MAN" as the Pokemon which is difficult to track and understand.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Exit Battle Screen:** Press 'A' to exit the battle screen and return to the overworld.
2.  **Vary Exploration:** Explore different directions instead of solely moving "up." Consider exploring left, right, and down to potentially discover new areas and Pokémon.
3.  **Strategic Route Planning:** Develop a more strategic route for exploration, perhaps following a specific path or landmark to avoid repetitive movement.
4.  **Document Pokemon Encounters:** The name, typing and move-set for the pokemon needs to be explicitly noted.
