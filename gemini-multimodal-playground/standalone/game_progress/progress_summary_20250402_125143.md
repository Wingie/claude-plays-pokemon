# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Reporting Period:** Turns 65-74

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, Coordinates (2, 11)
*   **Objective:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.
*   **Pokémon:** Pidgey - Level 7

## Recent Actions

The primary focus of the last ten turns has been engaging in battles within the tall grass. Specifically, the following actions were consistently repeated:

*   **Repeatedly engaged in battles with wild Rattata.**
*   **Utilized Pidgey's Tackle attack in combat.**
*   **Advanced through the post-battle screens after defeating Rattata.**
*   **Progressed through the level up screens after defeating multiple Rattata.**
*   **After leveling up, strategically navigated the overworld to re-enter the tall grass to encounter more Pokémon.**

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Consistent Encounters:** The tall grass is a reliable location for encountering wild Rattata.
*   **Effective Strategy:** Pidgey's Tackle attack is effective against Rattata at this stage of the game.
*   **Leveling Up:** Pidgey successfully leveled up to Level 7 through repeated battles.
*   **Game Mechanics:** The player is becoming more familiar with the game's battle and level-up protocols, understanding the need to press 'A' to proceed through various screens.
*   **Navigation:** Understanding the relationship between Overworld coordinates and the game environment (e.g., trees, tall grass) is developing.
*   **Resource management:** Pidgey is currently full health, so managing healing is not an immediate concern.

## Next Objectives

*   **Continue battling wild Pokémon in the tall grass.** The primary goal remains to gain more battle experience and level up Pidgey further.
*   **Explore alternative routes in the overworld.** Once Pidgey is at a higher level, consider exploring other areas beyond the immediate vicinity of the starting location (2,11).
*   **Consider catching additional Pokemon.** Though it is not explicitly stated, it is common to capture additional Pokémon to broaden the team and increase strategic options. Evaluate capture opportunities if presented.
*   **Learn other Battle strategies.** Look for opportunities to learn other battle moves and strategies for Pidgey.

## Challenges & Mitigation Strategies

*   **Monotony:** Repeatedly battling Rattata with the same attack might become monotonous. This can be addressed by finding new locations with different types of Pokémon, or capturing and training new Pokemon with different abilities.

## Conclusion

Significant progress has been made in achieving the initial goal of finding battles and learning how to fight. Pidgey has leveled up, and the player is gaining a better understanding of the game's mechanics. The immediate focus remains on battling and leveling up, but plans for future exploration and team expansion should be considered.
