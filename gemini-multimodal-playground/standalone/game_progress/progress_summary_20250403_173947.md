# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report: Viridian Forest Exploration

**Date:** 2024-10-27 (Assumed)

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest. We have entered the tall grass.
*   **State:** Exploring and engaging in battles to level up and search for Pikachu.
*   **Known Challenges:** Frequent encounters with Caterpie.
*   **Resources:** (Unknown - Need to track Health and Pokéball count)

## Recent Actions

*   **Movement:** Initially outside the tall grass in Viridian Forest. We moved left multiple times to enter the tall grass, now at an estimated location of (8,5).
*   **Battles:** Several encounters with Caterpie. Basic "Fight -> Move 1" strategy employed.
*   **Turn-by-Turn Breakdown:**
    *   Turns 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4: Repeatedly encountered Caterpie and used the first move in battle.
    *   Turn 1, 2, 4, and 5: Analyzed the overworld, specifically location relative to tall grass.
    *   Turn 3: Executed a plan to move left three times to enter the tall grass.
    *   Turn 5: Confirmed entry into tall grass and initiated a new strategy of random movement to trigger encounters.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Viridian Forest Location:** We are confirmed to be exploring Viridian Forest.
*   **Enemy Encounter Rate:** High encounter rate with Caterpie in the early stages of Viridian Forest.
*   **Movement Awareness:** We can track our location in the overworld (e.g., initial starting point in relation to tall grass). We can coordinate movement based on this location.
*   **Tall Grass Entry:** We successfully transitioned from outside the tall grass into the tall grass.
*   **Location Tracking Inconsistencies:** The location tracking seems to jump, with the coordinates changing between (7,5) and (8,5)

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Exploring Tall Grass:** Execute 3 random movement steps to trigger a battle.
2.  **Identify and Catch Pikachu:** Prioritize catching Pikachu when encountered.
3.  **Track Resources:** Implement a system to monitor Pokémon health and Pokéball count to ensure sustainability during exploration.
4.  **Consider Alternate Battle Strategies:** While "Fight -> Move 1" is a simple starting point, explore more strategic move selection based on opponent type for faster battles and less damage taken.
5.  **Refine Location Tracking:** Resolve the inconsistency in location tracking to maintain accurate positioning.
