# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Overall Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

Currently, we are facing a recurring issue of a poisoned Pidgey and inefficient Pokémon switching. We have a Mankey (MAN) available for battle and have recently entered a new battle against a "MAN". We seem to be stuck in a loop of selecting the "FIGHT" option in battle.

## Recent Actions (Turns 35-44)

*   **Turns 35-40:**  Repeated attempts to switch a poisoned Pidgey out of battle with Charmander have been unsuccessful. These turns suggest a potential misunderstanding of the game's menu navigation during battle or potentially a glitch. We repeatedly entered the Pokémon selection menu with the intent to switch, but the desired switch did not occur.
*   **Turn 41 & 42:** Exited the battle and saw the Pokémon info screen where Pidgey was still poisoned. Tried to switch Pokemon using the "SHIFT" option.
*   **Turn 43 & 44:**  Re-entered a battle (against "MAN"). Mankey is the active Pokémon, and the strategy has been simply selecting "FIGHT" without consideration of specific moves. This indicates a lack of understanding of Mankey's available moveset.

## Key Discoveries & Observations

*   **Persistent Poison Status:** The Pidgey's poison status is a significant hindrance, requiring a remedy or a consistent switch-out strategy.
*   **Menu Navigation Challenges:**  The difficulty in switching Pokémon during battle suggests a need to review the battle menu controls.
*   **Limited Move Knowledge:** We are currently selecting "FIGHT" without understanding the moves available to Mankey.
*   **Possible Glitch:** The repetition of switch-out failures could indicate a problem with the game state or the bot logic.
*   **Mysterious Opponent:** Facing a "MAN" could be a bug or simply the name of a trainer/pokemon.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Diagnose and Fix the Switching Issue:**
    *   Thoroughly review the Pokémon switching mechanics within battle. Is there a condition preventing the switch (e.g., enemy move, priority)?
    *   Double-check the control inputs to ensure accurate execution.
    *   Investigate the possibility of a glitch and if so, restart the game or revert to a previous save.
2.  **Learn Mankey's Moves:**
    *   Access Mankey's move list (possibly through the Pokémon info screen or online resources).
    *   Understand the type and power of each move to make strategic decisions in battle.
3.  **Develop a Battle Strategy:**
    *   Based on Mankey's moveset, formulate a basic battle strategy (e.g., use a specific move against a specific type of opponent).
4.  **Heal Pidgey:**
    *   Locate a Pokémon Center to cure Pidgey's poison and restore its health. This may involve backtracking to a known location.
    *   Consider using an antidote if available.
5. **Investigate the "MAN" Opponent:**
    * Determine if "MAN" is a common pokemon, trainer or a bug
