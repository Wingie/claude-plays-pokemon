# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Level up Mankey through battles.

**Current Status:** Exploring the tall grass south of Viridian City's Pokémon Center, actively engaging in wild Pokémon battles.

## Recent Actions (Turns 55-64)

*   **Turn 55-56:** Healed Pokémon at the Viridian City Pokémon Center and exited, acknowledging the presence of tall grass south of the center as a potential battle location.
*   **Turn 57-61:** Navigated towards and into the tall grass south of the Pokémon Center, attempting to trigger wild Pokémon encounters. Encountered a sign and a ledge, which required navigation around/over.
*   **Turn 62-64:** Initiated battle with a Wild Pidgey. Currently focusing on attacking with the first option, presumably the strongest move, to defeat the Pidgey and gain experience for Mankey.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Viridian City:** The area south of the Pokémon Center is confirmed to have tall grass suitable for wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Navigation Challenges:** The presence of ledges and signs near the tall grass presents minor navigation obstacles.
*   **Battle Strategy:** Preliminary battle strategy involves selecting the first attack option (presumably the strongest) against wild Pokémon.

## Next Objectives

*   **Continue Grinding:** Continue battling wild Pokémon (specifically Pidgey, as encountered so far) in the tall grass to gain experience points for Mankey and facilitate its level growth.
*   **Evaluate Battle Effectiveness:** Monitor the effectiveness of the chosen attack (first option) against wild Pokémon.  Consider exploring alternative attack options if battles are inefficient or challenging.
*   **Monitor Mankey's Growth:** Keep track of Mankey's level and stats.  Consider returning to the Pokémon Center to heal if Mankey's health becomes low.
*   **Future Exploration:** Once Mankey has reached a satisfactory level, consider exploring further south from Viridian City and Route 1 to discover new areas and encounter more challenging Pokémon.
