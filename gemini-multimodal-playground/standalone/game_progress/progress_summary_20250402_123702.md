# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Our trainer is currently navigating tall grass, searching for wild Pokémon battles to gain experience and improve combat skills.
*   Charmander is at Level 10 and currently at full health.
*   Main goal: Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

**Recent Actions:**

*   Engaged in a battle against a Level 3 Pidgey and won using the "Scratch" attack.
*   Gained 23 EXP points from the battle with Pidgey.
*   After exiting the battle, we have been exploring the tall grass, attempting to trigger new encounters.
*   Experimented with moving in different directions (up, left, down) within the tall grass to find more battles.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Battling in tall grass is the primary method for encountering wild Pokémon.
*   "Scratch" is an effective attack for Charmander at its current level.
*   Movement is somewhat restricted by trees, requiring strategic navigation.
*   Gaining experience points is a direct result of winning battles.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   Difficulty in quickly finding new battles. Movement in the tall grass hasn't immediately led to new encounters.
*   Potential for limited movement due to tree obstacles.
*   No clear understanding of optimal movement patterns for encounter rates.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Continued Exploration:** Persist in moving through the tall grass in various directions until another battle is triggered.
2.  **Pathfinding:** Try to identify a clear path through the tall grass that minimizes unnecessary backtracking and maximizes the chance of finding new battles.
3.  **Battle Readiness:** Maintain Charmander's health by avoiding unnecessary damage.
4.  **Evaluate Movement Patterns:** After trying each direction, reflect to discover patterns that optimize chance of encounter. If encounter is not triggered after each movement, try the opposite direction.
