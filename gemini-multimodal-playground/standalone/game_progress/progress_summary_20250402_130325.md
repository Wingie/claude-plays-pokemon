# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 85-94

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

HAN, our Pokémon, is currently at full health (19/19 HP). We are actively seeking out and engaging in battles. We successfully fled one recent battle.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turn 85-88:** Utilized a Potion to restore HAN's HP from a low state to full (19/19). This involved navigating the Items menu, selecting the Potion, and applying it to HAN.
*   **Turns 89, 90, 92:** Engaged in battles with Pidgey, consistently using the first attack option. The outcome of these battles (win/lose/flee) besides turn 94 is currently unclear.
*   **Turns 91, 93:** Briefly entered the Items menu with the Potion selected, likely accidentally, before exiting. This indicates a potential for misclicks or accidental menu navigation.
*   **Turn 94:** Successfully fled a battle. This might indicate a change in strategy or facing a particularly difficult opponent.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Potion Management:** We are capable of using Potions to heal our Pokémon, a crucial mechanic for sustaining battles.
*   **Pidgey Encounters:** Pidgey appear to be common encounters in the current area.
*   **Flee Option:** We successfully utilized the "flee" option, indicating awareness of this battle strategy.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Potion Necessity:** The initial need to use a Potion indicates previous damage sustained, suggesting a possible need for improved battle strategy or training.
*   **Accidental Menu Access:** The repeated, unnecessary entry and exit of the Items menu suggest potential challenges with menu navigation, which could hinder progress in more crucial situations.
*   **Unknown Battle Outcomes:** The outcome of the Pidgey battles (turns 89, 90, 92) remains unclear.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Engage and Win Battles:** Continue seeking out battles and focusing on securing victories against wild Pokémon. Aim to understand why HAN's health was previously low and avoid similar situations.
2.  **Optimize Battle Strategy:** Evaluate the effectiveness of our current "first attack option" strategy. Consider exploring other attack options, especially if facing stronger or more diverse opponents.
3.  **Improve Menu Navigation:** Focus on precise and efficient menu navigation to avoid accidental entries and exits.
4.  **Explore the Environment:** Once HAN is sufficiently leveled, consider venturing into new areas to discover new Pokémon and challenges.
