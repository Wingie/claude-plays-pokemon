# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Expedition

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest, Coordinates (4, 5)
*   **Environment:** Tall grass present.
*   **Lead Pokémon HP:** 29/31 (Healthy)
*   **Needs Healing:** No
*   **Poké Ball Count:** Unknown (Need to track this!)
*   **In Battle:** Currently engaged in battle.
*   **Opponent:** Caterpie

## II. Recent Actions & Observations

*   **Initial Exploration (Turns 0-2):** Entered Viridian Forest and initiated random movement within the tall grass to trigger encounters. We are relying on random movement for exploration initially.
*   **First Encounter (Turn 3):** Encountered a Caterpie. The game entered battle mode.
*   **Battle Strategy (Turns 3-9):**
    *   Turns 3-6: Repeatedly pressed the 'A' button during the battle text phase, likely to advance the dialogue and get to an actionable battle menu.
    *   Turns 7-9: Now at the Battle Active screen.  Repeatedly chose the "Fight" option followed by the first available move.  We are currently engaging the Caterpie in battle.
*   **HP Status:** We've gained some insight into our lead Pokémon's HP, it is currently at 29/31 and is not deemed as needing to be healed.
*   **No Pikachu Sighting:** We have not encountered a Pikachu yet.  Caterpie seems to be the dominant species in our current location.

## III. Key Discoveries & Challenges

*   **Game State Detection:** We've successfully transitioned between overworld exploration, battle introduction text, and the battle menu itself.
*   **HP Tracking:** We are now able to track the lead Pokémon's health and determine if healing is necessary.
*   **Battle System:** The core battle system is functional; we can initiate attacks.
*   **Pikachu Elusive:** The primary challenge remains finding a Pikachu. Random movement is proving inefficient for targeted Pokémon encounters.
*   **Resource Management:** We have not tracked how many Pokeballs we have and need to keep track of that.

## IV. Next Objectives & Strategic Adjustments

1.  **Continue Pikachu Search:** Prioritize encountering more Pokémon in Viridian Forest.
2.  **Improve Encounter Strategy:** Consider alternative movement patterns (e.g., systematically exploring specific areas) to increase the chances of encountering Pikachu. Purely random movement is inefficient.
3.  **Track Resources:** Implement a system to track the number of Poké Balls remaining.  We need to know if we can actually catch a Pikachu when we find one!
4.  **Battle Efficiency:**  Once we know the moveset of our lead Pokemon, we need to develop a more sophisticated battle strategy beyond repeatedly selecting the first move.
5. **HP Threshold:** Establish a clear HP threshold for when to prioritize healing at the Pokémon Center.
6. **Location Mapping:** Begin to internally map the layout of Viridian Forest to optimize movement and encounter rates.
