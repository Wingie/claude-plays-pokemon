# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 35 - 44

**Current Goal:** Level up our Pokémon.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently engaged in repeated battles, presumably in a training area.
*   **Pokémon:** Pikachu is the active battler.
*   **Battle Status:** Experiencing consistent battles with Weedle.
*   **Progression:** Minimal progress evident in leveling up. Battles consist of repeated use of GROWL and taking damage from Weedle.

## Recent Actions

The primary activity has been engaging in battles. The following sequence of actions has been repeated:

1.  Initiate "FIGHT" in the battle menu.
2.  Select "THUNDERSHOCK" as the attack move (intended, but in practice `GROWL` is used instead)
3.  Advance through dialog showing Pikachu's attack ("PIKA used GROWL!")
4.  Advance through dialog showing Weedle's attack ("Foe WEEDLE used STRING SHOT!")
5.  Return to the battle menu to repeat the process.

**Observed Issues:**

*   Despite selecting THUNDERSHOCK, Pikachu appears to be using GROWL instead. This indicates a potential control error or a misinterpretation of the in-game output.

## Key Discoveries

*   Encountering Weedle consistently as a training opponent.
*   Weedle uses the move "STRING SHOT".
*   **CRITICAL: The intended "THUNDERSHOCK" selection is not being executed. Pikachu is repeatedly using "GROWL" instead, hindering progress.**

## Next Objectives

1.  **Investigate Move Selection Error:** Determine why "THUNDERSHOCK" is not being executed. This could be due to:
    *   Accidental de-selection after confirming.
    *   Incorrect button presses.
    *   A bug in the game's input interpretation (less likely).
2.  **Implement Correct Move Execution:** Once the reason for the error is identified, correct the input sequence to ensure "THUNDERSHOCK" is used in battle.
3.  **Optimize Leveling Strategy:** If "THUNDERSHOCK" proves ineffective against Weedle, consider alternative strategies for leveling up Pikachu, such as finding different opponents.
4.  **Potentially: Consider Catching new Pokemon for additional type coverage and a wider range of available moves.**
