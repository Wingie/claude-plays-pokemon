## Current Status

Currently, we are exploring an area with tall grass in the overworld. Our Pokémon is actively engaging in battles to fulfill our primary objective. Our Pokémon's health is currently at 9/19 after recent battles.

## Recent Actions

*   **Exploration:** We have been consistently exploring the tall grass in the overworld to encounter wild Pokémon.
*   **Battling:** We have engaged in several battles, resulting in both wins and ongoing confrontations. We are currently in a battle with a wild Pidgey.
*   **Battle Strategy:** We are employing the "Scratch" attack consistently in battles.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Frequent Encounters:** Tall grass is a reliable location for encountering wild Pokémon (Pidgey confirmed).
*   **Battle Reliance:** The "Scratch" attack is currently our primary offensive strategy.
*   **Health Management:** Our Pokemon's health is at 9/19 and will need to be monitored.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Win Current Battle:** Our immediate priority is to win the ongoing battle against the wild Pidgey. This likely involves continuing to use the "Scratch" attack and monitoring our Pokémon's health.
2.  **Continue Exploring:** After the current battle, we will continue exploring the tall grass to encounter and battle more Pokémon.
3.  **Maintain Health:** Monitor and manage our Pokémon's health closely. If the health gets too low we will need to find a way to heal our pokemon.
