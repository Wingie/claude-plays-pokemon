# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore the world and encounter a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently in or near Viridian City (inferred from actions, location name still unknown in game).
*   **Party Condition:** Lead Pokémon (Pidgey) at low health (15/27 HP). Needs Healing.
*   **Progress:** Initial exploration has led to identifying a Pokémon Center.
*   **Known Locations:** Pokémon Center (location assumed to be Viridian City), Tall grass nearby, likely in Viridian Forest
*   **Overall Objective Status:** Encountering Pikachu delayed due to low health. Healing priority.

## II. Recent Actions and Narrative

The initial goal was to find tall grass and encounter a Pikachu. The turns played out as follows:

*   **Turns 0-2:** Began exploring and moved towards visible tall grass, presumably near the starting town.
*   **Turn 3-4:** Entered a building (likely the Pokémon Center) while trying to locate the tall grass, then attempted to exit.
*   **Turns 17-21:** Discovered that Pidgey's HP was very low. Prioritized finding and entering the Pokémon Center to heal. Viridian Forest and Viridian City PC were set as the current objectives, however the Pokemon center was closer than the viridian forest, and Pidgey was prioritized.

## III. Key Discoveries

*   **Location of Pokémon Center:** Successfully located a Pokémon Center and is currently moving to enter it. Likely located in Viridian City.
*   **Low Health:** Pidgey's low HP is a significant obstacle and necessitates immediate healing.
*   **Tall Grass:** Located tall grass, which is a potential habitat for Pikachu. Likely in Viridian Forest

## IV. Challenges Faced

*   **Low Health Management:** Pidgey's low HP has forced a detour from the original goal of finding Pikachu.
*   **Navigation:** Initial exploration was somewhat aimless due to lack of clear objectives and landmarks. Setting the Viridian City PC and Viridian Forest locations as objectives should assist with direction in the future.
*   **Menu Navigation:** The agent opened the menu when it wasn't required.
*   **Environment Awareness:** Initial exploration was poor, the agent didn't explore and look for landmarks.

## V. Next Objectives

1.  **Heal Pidgey:** Enter the Pokémon Center and fully heal Pidgey to restore its HP.
2.  **Return to Tall Grass:** After healing, navigate back to the tall grass area (Viridian Forest) to resume the search for Pikachu.
3.  **Encounter Wild Pokémon:** Engage with wild Pokémon in the tall grass, specifically looking for Pikachu.
4.  **Explore Viridian Forest:** Methodically explore the Viridian Forest to find Pikachu and gather resources.

## VI. Strategic Insights

*   **Prioritize Health:** Managing Pokémon health is crucial for sustained exploration. Healing should be prioritized when HP is low.
*   **Objective Setting:** Setting clear objectives (e.g., "reach the Pokémon Center", "find tall grass") improves navigation and decision-making.
*   **Exploration Strategy:** Develop a more systematic approach to exploring new areas, focusing on identifying landmarks and mapping the environment.
*   **Environment Awareness:** Improved image analysis and object recognition will improve the bot's awareness of the environment.
