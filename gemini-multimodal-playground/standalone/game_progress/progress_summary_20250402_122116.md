**Current Goal:** find battles to grow the mankey

# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report (Turns 90-99)

**Current Status:**

*   In the overworld, surrounded by tall grass. Location is currently unknown.
*   Primary objective: Find battles to level up Mankey.
*   Mankey's health is a recurring concern, frequently reported as being low.

**Recent Actions (Turns 90-99):**

*   Actively seeking wild Pokémon battles in the tall grass to train Mankey.
*   Initially attempted to run from battles when Mankey's health was low. This strategy was abandoned after Turn 92.
*   Successfully won at least one battle against a wild Pidgey (Turn 93), resulting in 23 EXP gained for Mankey.
*   Repeatedly navigating upwards in the tall grass to encounter more Pokémon.

**Key Discoveries & Observations:**

*   **Enemy Pokémon:** Common encounters with wild Pidgeys.
*   **Low Health Risk:** Mankey's low health presents a significant challenge, necessitating careful battle management or avoidance (initially).
*   **Experience Gain:** Battles yield experience points that contribute to Mankey's growth, albeit in small increments so far.

**Challenges & Obstacles:**

*   **Mankey's Low Health:** This significantly limits the ability to engage in prolonged battles and forces the need to consider running or healing.
*   **Repetitive Encounters:** Frequent encounters with the same Pokémon (Pidgey) may slow down the leveling process.
*   **Unknown Location:** Lack of information about the specific location makes it difficult to plan strategic movements.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Continue Searching for Battles:** Prioritize finding wild Pokémon battles to increase Mankey's experience points.
2.  **Prioritize Mankey's Health:** Develop a strategy to manage Mankey's health effectively. This could involve:
    *   Carrying and using potions when health is low.
    *   Running from battles strategically if potions are unavailable.
    *   Potentially switching to a different, healthier Pokémon if available and appropriate.
3.  **Explore the Surroundings:** Attempt to identify the current location and potentially discover areas with a wider variety of Pokémon or healing resources.
4.  **Optimize Battle Strategy:** Based on the frequency of Pidgey encounters, develop a more efficient strategy for defeating them quickly and minimizing damage to Mankey.

**Revised Strategy Considerations:**

*   Since a Pidgey was defeated, consider battling *every* Pidgey to level Mankey.
*   Acquire Potions as soon as possible to heal Mankey between battles.
*   Once a sufficient level is achieved, consider teaching Mankey a new move.
