## Key Discoveries

*   **Location of Training Area:** Confirmed the presence of tall grass south of the Viridian City Pokémon Center as a suitable location for encountering wild Pokémon.
*   **Pokémon Center Utility:** Reaffirmed the importance of utilizing Pokémon Centers for healing before and potentially after engaging in battles.
*   **Viridian City Layout:** Encountered minor navigational obstacles (sign, ledge) requiring adjustments to the planned route.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Engage in Battles:** Successfully enter the tall grass south of Viridian City and initiate battles with wild Pokémon.
