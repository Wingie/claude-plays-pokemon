# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest
*   **Activity:** Currently engaged in a wild Pokémon battle.
*   **Lead Pokémon HP:** 24/24 (Full HP)
*   **In Tall Grass:** Yes
*   **Encounter Type:** Continuous wild Pokémon battles.
*   **Target Pokemon (Desired):** Pikachu
*   **Battle Frequency:** Very Frequent
*    **Pokeball Count:** Unknown

## Recent Actions & Summary

Our primary objective is to navigate Viridian Forest and capture a Pikachu. Initial attempts focused on entering the tall grass, encountering some resistance to directional inputs. Since entering the tall grass, the majority of actions have been dedicated to battling wild Pokémon. The player has repeatedly encountered Kakuna in these battles and has engaged in battles.

*   **Turns 5-8:** Repeatedly attempted to enter the tall grass in Viridian Forest by pressing "Up".
*   **Turns 9-14:** Engaged in continuous battles with Kakuna within Viridian Forest. The player has been selecting "Fight" and the first available move in each battle.

## Key Discoveries & Observations

*   **High Encounter Rate:** Viridian Forest has a very high encounter rate with wild Pokémon in the tall grass.
*   **Common Pokémon:** Kakuna appears to be a very common Pokémon in this section of Viridian Forest.
*   **Directional Movement Issues:** Experienced initial difficulty entering the tall grass, requiring multiple attempts at directional input. This suggests potential input lag or sensitivity issues with the controls.
*   **Absence of Pikachu:** Despite numerous encounters, a Pikachu has not yet been found.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Kakuna Overload:** The constant encounters with Kakuna are hindering progress towards finding a Pikachu.
*   **Lack of Variety:** Only encountering Kakuna so far limits experience gain and resources.
*   **Unknown Resources:** Our supply of Poke Balls and Potions (if any) remains unknown, which could become a problem if lead Pokémon takes heavy damage in future battles.
*   **Stale Gameplay Loop:** The repetitive battle pattern (Fight -> First Move) is inefficient. Needs more strategic battle planning.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Exploring Viridian Forest:** Persist in traversing the tall grass to increase the chance of encountering a Pikachu. This may require exploring different areas within the forest.
2.  **Implement Strategic Battle Decisions:** Once a diverse set of moves are available, plan strategically to ensure efficient battles and minimize damage taken. Currently, the simplistic "Fight -> First Move" approach is acceptable.
3. **Determine Pokeball Count:** Must establish how many pokeballs the player possesses.
4.  **If no Pikachu is found, re-evaluate strategy**: Consider purchasing more Pokeballs in Viridian City and/or catching other Pokemon to diversify our team and earn experience.

## Long-Term Goals

*   Catch a Pikachu.
*   Fully explore Viridian Forest.
*   Progress beyond Viridian Forest.
