# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Locate the Pokémon Mart with a blue roof in Viridian City.

## Current Status

We are currently located near the exit of Viridian Forest, still attempting to navigate around a ledge and a non-player character (NPC) to the north. Progress towards Viridian City is stalled due to navigation challenges.

## Recent Actions (Turns 28-49)

Recent turns have been primarily focused on navigating around an obstacle consisting of a ledge and an NPC blocking the direct path north to Viridian City. The initial strategy involved moving left to circumvent the obstacle.

*   **Initial Strategy (Turns 28-40):** Repeated attempts to move left, aiming to go around the ledge. This led to a perceived loop.
*   **Alternative Strategies (Turns 41-49):** Attempts to break the loop by moving upwards (Turn 41) and attempting a sequence of left movements (Turn 43). However, progress remains limited. A shift to moving right was attempted in Turn 49.

## Key Discoveries & Challenges

*   **Obstacle Identification:** Confirmed the presence of a ledge and NPC obstructing the direct northern path to Viridian City.
*   **Navigation Challenges:** Difficulty in navigating the terrain, resulting in a perceived movement loop.
*   **Ineffective Strategy:** Repeatedly moving left proved unsuccessful in bypassing the obstacle.
*   **Adaptive Strategy:** Acknowledgment of the stalled progress prompted a shift in strategy, exploring alternative directions.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Re-evaluate Navigation:** Analyze the surroundings more carefully to identify a clear path around the ledge and NPC. Consider potential hidden pathways or alternative routes.
2.  **Strategic Movement:** Implement a more deliberate and less repetitive movement pattern. Experiment with a combination of left, right, up, and down movements to find the correct path.
3.  **Seek Additional Information:** If possible, attempt to interact with the NPC blocking the path. They might provide hints or information regarding the correct route to Viridian City.
4.  **Continue Exploration:** Persistent exploration of the area around Viridian Forest is necessary to locate Viridian City.
