## Current Status

The player, referred to as "GGGGG," is currently located in Pallet Town, specifically in front of the town sign. GGGGG has just received the Pokédex. The primary objective is to reach Viridian City, located to the north of Pallet Town. The initial plan is to traverse Route 1 to reach Viridian City.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 0-4:** Received the Pokédex after engaging in dialogue. The Pokédex is described as a high-tech encyclopedia that automatically records data on Pokémon.
*   **Turns 95-99:** Attempted to leave Pallet Town and head north towards Route 1 and Viridian City. However, a fence blocks the direct path north. Current strategy involves navigating around the obstacle.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Map Navigation:** Viridian City is located north of Pallet Town, accessible via Route 1.
*   **Obstacle Encountered:** A fence blocks the direct path north out of Pallet Town.

## Challenges

*   **Pathfinding:** Difficulty navigating out of Pallet Town due to the fence obstacle. This requires exploring alternative routes.
*   **Repetitive Dialogue:** Initial turns were consumed by repetitive dialogue, indicating potential time spent on unavoidable story elements.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Route to Route 1:** Find a path around the fence in Pallet Town to reach Route 1. The current planned movement is right, then up, then left.
2.  **Exploration of Route 1:** Upon reaching Route 1, explore the area and potentially encounter wild Pokémon.
3.  **Journey to Viridian City:** Continue north along Route 1 to eventually reach Viridian City.

## Notes

The game appears to be in the very early stages. Obtaining the Pokédex is a key milestone. Pathfinding challenges are present, and require creative problem-solving. Future progress will depend on successful navigation of the game world.
