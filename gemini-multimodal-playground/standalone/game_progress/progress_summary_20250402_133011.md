# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Exploring the overworld, specifically tall grass, in search of a Pikachu.
*   Engaged in a battle with a wild Pidgey.
*   Our lead Pokémon, MAN, has 14/22 HP.

**Recent Actions (Turns 10-19):**

*   **Turn 10:** Acknowledged the end of a previous battle and the EXP gain for MAN (16 EXP). Set the goal to find a Pikachu.
*   **Turn 11:** Moved into tall grass to search for wild Pokémon battles.
*   **Turns 12:** Explored the tall grass, taking a few steps to trigger encounters.
*   **Turns 13-19:** Initiated battle with a wild Pidgey and repeatedly used the "Scratch" move. MAN's HP has been reduced to 14/22.

**Key Discoveries/Observations:**

*   **Pikachu Elusive:** Despite actively searching in tall grass, we have not yet encountered a Pikachu.
*   **Pidgey Common:** The primary wild Pokémon encountered so far is Pidgey.
*   **Battle Strategy:** The strategy of using "Scratch" has been consistent but has resulted in some damage to our Pokémon.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Low HP:** MAN's health is decreasing during the battle with the Pidgey, which might lead to the need for healing items or a visit to a Pokémon Center.
*   **Pikachu Encounter Rate:** Finding a Pikachu seems to be more difficult than initially anticipated.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Defeat the Pidgey:** Continue the current battle with the Pidgey and attempt to defeat it.
2.  **Monitor HP:** Closely monitor MAN's HP. If it gets too low (below 10), consider using a Potion or retreating to heal.
3.  **Continue Pikachu Search:** After the battle, resume exploring tall grass in the hopes of finding a Pikachu. Consider exploring different areas of tall grass to increase encounter chances.
4.  **Potentially Explore Different Locations:** If Pikachu proves to be too rare in the current area, research alternative locations where Pikachu might be found and move to those areas.
