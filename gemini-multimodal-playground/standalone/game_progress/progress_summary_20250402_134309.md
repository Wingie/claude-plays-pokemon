# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 15 - 24

**Current Goal:** Explore the world and attempt to encounter a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Tall Grass (Route Unknown - presumably near the starting area)
*   **Party:**
    *   Pidgey - Level 9, HP: 24/27. Moves: Tackle, Sand-Attack, Gust.
*   **Overall:** Actively exploring tall grass areas, hoping to encounter a Pikachu. HP is currently acceptable and no immediate need for healing.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turn 15-18:** Engaged in a battle with a Level 3 Rattata. Used Gust to defeat it.
*   **Turn 19:** Received 24 experience points for Pidgey after defeating the Rattata.
*   **Turn 20-23:** Navigated the tall grass (positions noted in initial reports, though location ultimately unknown) using exploratory movements (Down, Right, Left, Up) to trigger wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Turn 24:** Entered a battle with a Caterpie. Initial move selection initiated.

## Key Discoveries and Observations

*   **Combat Efficiency:** Gust is effective against low-level Normal-type Pokémon like Rattata.
*   **Encounter Rate:** Moving within the tall grass reliably triggers encounters with wild Pokémon.
*   **Pokémon Variety:** Encountered Rattata and Caterpie, showcasing early-game Pokémon availability.
*   **Pikachu Elusiveness:** Despite dedicated searching, a Pikachu has not yet been encountered. This suggests they may be rare, located in specific areas, or require certain conditions to appear.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Repetitive Encounters:** Frequent encounters with common Pokémon (Rattata, Caterpie) slow down the search for Pikachu.
*   **Unknown Location:** While initial turns noted coordinates, the exact location within the game world is currently unknown.
*   **Move Selection (Turn 24):** The report had no explicit move listed besides selecting the first move. Need a better plan for picking what move to choose when going into battle.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Pikachu Search:** Persist in exploring tall grass areas, prioritizing areas not yet thoroughly investigated.
2.  **Caterpie Battle (Turn 24 onwards):** Successfully navigate the battle with Caterpie. Analyze effectiveness of moves and adjust strategy accordingly.
3.  **Map Awareness:** Establish a better understanding of the current location within the game world. This could involve referencing a map or identifying landmarks.
4.  **Develop Move Strategy:** Research moves and determine best one to use.
