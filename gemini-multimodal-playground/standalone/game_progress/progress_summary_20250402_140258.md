# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest
*   **Lead Pokémon HP:** 24/29 (Low HP - *Needs Healing*)
*   **In Battle:** Yes, currently battling a Caterpie.
*   **Pikachu Encountered:** No

## Recent Actions (Turns 30-39)

The primary focus has been navigating Viridian Forest. Initially, the objective was to move towards the Viridian City Pokémon Center due to low HP. However, repeated attempts to move down resulted in the AI getting stuck in a loop. After recognizing this, a change in direction was attempted (moving left). This unfortunately led to an encounter with a Caterpie. The last few turns (37-39) have been spent engaged in the battle with the Caterpie, selecting the first move repeatedly.

## Key Discoveries & Challenges

*   **Viridian Forest is Dangerous:** Random encounters are frequent, draining the lead Pokémon's health.
*   **Navigation Issues:** The AI was initially getting stuck in a loop while trying to move down, indicating potential issues with pathfinding in the forest.
*   **Low HP Priority:** The AI correctly identifies when HP is low and prioritizes healing, though the implementation of moving towards the PC needs improvement.
*   **Battle Engagement:** The AI correctly identifies when it's in a battle and is selecting a move.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Defeat Caterpie:** Finish the current battle and hopefully emerge victorious without sustaining further damage.
2.  **Heal Pokémon:** After the battle, immediately prioritize getting to the Viridian City Pokémon Center to heal the lead Pokémon. This is crucial for continued exploration.
3.  **Improve Navigation:** Implement a more robust pathfinding strategy to avoid getting stuck in loops when moving through the forest. Consider a more strategic approach to minimize encounters when HP is low, perhaps by sticking to visible paths.
4.  **Resume Pikachu Hunt:** Once healed and navigation is improved, return to exploring the forest and actively search for Pikachu.

## Overall Progress

Progress towards the primary goal of catching a Pikachu has stalled due to navigation problems and the need for healing. The encounter with Caterpie has further delayed the mission. The focus needs to shift to addressing the immediate health concerns and improving movement strategies within Viridian Forest before continuing the Pikachu hunt.
