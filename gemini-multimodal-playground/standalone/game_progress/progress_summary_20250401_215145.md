# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Locate the blue-roofed PokeMart in Viridian City.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Route 1, near Viridian City. Position: (5, 9)
*   **Immediate Obstacle:** A sign directly north of our current position is preventing direct northward progress.
*   **Overall Progress:** We have successfully navigated out of the starting town and are currently on Route 1, actively attempting to enter Viridian City.

## Recent Actions

*   **Movement:** Primarily focused on heading north from the starting location.
*   **Obstacle Navigation:** Encountered a sign requiring strategic maneuvering. We have attempted multiple routes around it.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Route 1:** We've identified our location as Route 1, the route leading to Viridian City.
*   **Sign Obstacle:** A persistent sign north of position (5,9) is blocking direct northward movement.
*   **Failed Navigation:** Attempting "left, up, right" and "right, up, left" around the sign at (5,9) did not result in movement.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Navigate the Sign:** Continue experimenting with movement strategies to bypass the sign.  Potential strategies include:
    *   Trying a different combination of directional movements (e.g., right, right, up, left, left).
    *   Investigating if interacting with the sign provides any clues or triggers.
2.  **Reach Viridian City:** Once past the sign, proceed north to enter Viridian City.
3.  **Locate PokeMart:** Upon entering Viridian City, explore the area to find the PokeMart with the distinctive blue roof.
