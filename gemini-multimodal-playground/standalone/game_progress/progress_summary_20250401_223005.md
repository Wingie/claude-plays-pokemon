# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Route 1, approaching Viridian City.
*   **Primary Goal:** Reach Viridian City and locate the Poké Mart with the blue roof.
*   **Obstacle:** A ledge and a person are blocking the direct path north towards Viridian City.

## Recent Actions (Turns 12-29)

The primary actions taken have focused on navigating Route 1 to reach Viridian City. A repetitive pattern of encountering wild Rattata and pressing 'up' to move north was observed initially. Progress was then impeded by a ledge and a non-player character (NPC) blocking the path. The strategy has now shifted to moving left to circumvent the obstacle.

*   **Turns 12-15, 19:** Repeatedly attempted to move north, encountering and defeating wild Rattata. Charmander gained 32 EXP, likely from a successful battle.
*   **Turn 21:** Identified the need to move left due to a ledge at position (6, 11).
*   **Turns 23, 27-29:** Continued to attempt moving left to navigate around the ledge and NPC.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Route Navigation:** The initial straight path north is blocked.
*   **Obstacles:** Ledges are impassable without maneuvering. NPCs can block paths.
*   **Battle Experience:** Charmander gained 32 EXP.
*   **Location Awareness:** Determined current location to be (6, 11) in turn 21.

## Analysis and Insights

The repeated encounters with wild Rattata early on highlight the frequency of battles in Route 1. The player's strategy of simply pressing 'up' initially proved ineffective due to the terrain. The ledge represents a navigational challenge that requires a different approach. The player correctly identified the need to move left to circumvent this obstacle, however no progress has been made in the past few turns.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Circumnavigate the Ledge:** Continue pressing 'left' until a path north becomes available.
2.  **Reach Viridian City:** Once past the ledge, resume moving north to enter Viridian City.
3.  **Locate the Blue-Roofed Poké Mart:** Explore Viridian City to identify the Poké Mart with a blue roof.
4.  **Interact with Poké Mart:** Enter the Poké Mart and interact with the shopkeeper.
