# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up the Mankey through wild Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

The player is currently located in a tall grass area in the Overworld. The party consists of at least one Pokémon, Mankey, that requires experience points through battle. The player has recently caught a Weedle.

## Recent Actions (Turns 15-24)

*   **Turn 15:** Declined to give a nickname to the newly captured Weedle.
*   **Turns 16-24:** Repeatedly attempted to move upwards in tall grass to trigger wild Pokémon encounters to level up Mankey.

## Key Discoveries & Challenges

*   **Obstacle:** A ledge was identified as blocking the player's northward progress initially (Turn 20).
*   **Navigation:** The player recognized the need to navigate around the ledge by moving right before attempting to move upwards again.
*   **Encounter Rate:** Despite consistent movement in tall grass, the player has not yet encountered any wild Pokémon after resolving the ledge issue.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Grinding:** Persist in moving through tall grass to trigger wild Pokémon encounters to level up Mankey.
2.  **Strategic Movement:** If encounters remain elusive, consider experimenting with different movement patterns (e.g., moving in a grid pattern, exploring different areas within the tall grass region) to potentially increase the encounter rate.
3.  **Re-evaluate Location:** If grinding proves ineffective after a reasonable amount of time, consider the possibility that the current location is not optimal for finding suitable Pokémon to battle and explore other areas that may offer better opportunities.
