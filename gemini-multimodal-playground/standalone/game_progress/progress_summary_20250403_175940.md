# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report: Viridian Forest

**Date:** Current Date
**Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest
*   **Environment:** Currently in battle with a Kakuna.
*   **Progress:** Initial exploration halted due to encounter. Still outside of tall grass at coordinates (7,5) before the battle.
*   **Concerns:** No information on Pokemon moves or type advantages.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 0-5:** Repeated attempts to move from coordinates (7, 5) to the designated grass location (3,4) to search for Pikachu. No progress made, as the same observation and planning loop occurred each turn.
*   **Turns 6-9:** Engaged in a wild Pokémon battle against a Kakuna. No specific moves selected due to lack of information; generic attack (button 'A') used repeatedly.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Confirmed Location:** Successfully located within Viridian Forest.
*   **Coordinate Awareness:** Gained ability to detect coordinates on the Overworld.
*   **Wild Encounter:** Encountered a wild Kakuna, initiating a battle.
*  **Designated Grass Location:** There is a desgnated grass location (3,4) that may improve Pikachu spawn rates.

## Challenges

*   **Navigation:** Initial turns were stuck in a loop due to unclear movement execution.
*   **Combat Strategy:** Lack of information on Pokémon moves and type matchups hinders effective battle strategy.
*   **Pikachu Elusiveness:** Pikachu has not yet been encountered.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Resolve Kakuna Battle:** Continue battling the Kakuna using generic attacks until the battle is won or lost.
2.  **Re-engage Navigation:** Once the battle is over, resume navigating from coordinates (7, 5) to the designated grass location (3,4) within Viridian Forest to find Pikachu.
3.  **Prioritize Pikachu Capture:** When a Pikachu is encountered, attempt to weaken it and use a Poké Ball to capture it.
4.  **Gather Battle Information:** Pay attention to the effectivness of different attacks on different pokemon to build a better database.

## Strategic Notes

*   **Movement Execution:** Need to ensure proper movement action to reach the tall grass effectively and break out of repeating loop.
*   **Combat Data Collection:** Start recording Pokémon types, moves, and their effectiveness to improve future battle strategies.
*   **Poké Ball Management:** Monitor the number of available Poké Balls to ensure adequate resources for capturing Pikachu.
