# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Return to Pallet Town, visit Gary's house, and obtain the Town Map from his sister.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Unknown, recently exited a battle. Critically low HP.
*   **Party Status:** Lead Pokémon at 9/21 HP, significantly below the healing threshold. `needs_healing = True`.
*   **Progress Towards Goal:** Significant deviation. Originally heading south towards Pallet Town, but detoured after entering a building and engaging in multiple battles.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 0-3:** Initial turns focused on navigating south from an unknown starting location, aiming for Pallet Town.
*   **Turn 4:** Entered a building identified as a Pokémon Center (incorrectly). Attempted to exit south.
*   **Turns 7-9:** Encountered and won a battle against a wild Pidgey. Sustained damage, dropping HP to critical level (9/21). Repeatedly returning to battle end screen.
*   **Turns 10-11:** More battles. Leveling up sequence observed. HP remains critically low. Continuing to register on battle end screen.

## Key Discoveries and Challenges

*   **Incorrect Location Identification:** Misidentified a building as a Pokémon Center, leading to wasted time.
*   **Low HP Management:** Multiple battles resulted in critically low HP, necessitating a detour to a Pokémon Center. The healing threshold calculation (30% of max HP) is being consistently applied.
*   **Navigation Issues:** Current location is unknown, and route back to Pallet Town is unclear.
*   **Battle Screen Persistence:** The game seems to be getting stuck showing screens related to battle/level up.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Location Assessment:** Determine current location and identify the nearest Pokémon Center.
2.  **Heal Party:** Prioritize healing the lead Pokémon's HP at the Pokémon Center.
3.  **Navigation to Pallet Town:** Once healed, resume the original objective of traveling south to Pallet Town.
4.  **Obtain Town Map:** Visit Gary's house and speak with his sister to receive the Town Map.
