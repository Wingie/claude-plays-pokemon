# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report: Route 1 Exploration

**Current Status:**

*   Exploring Route 1 with the primary objective of finding and engaging in battles to gain experience and learn combat mechanics.
*   Currently navigating tall grass patches, a known habitat for wild Pokémon.
*   Facing challenges with navigation due to ledges and fences blocking direct northward movement.

**Recent Actions (Turns 50-59):**

*   **Focused Movement:** The player has consistently attempted to move within the tall grass on Route 1, prioritizing areas likely to harbor wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Initial Strategy: Northward Progression:** Initially, the player focused on moving north, repeatedly entering tall grass to trigger encounters.
*   **Obstacle Recognition:**  The player encountered a ledge blocking further northward progress, prompting a shift in strategy (Turn 56, Turn 58).
*   **Strategy Adjustment:** Recognizing the lack of progress moving directly north, the player experimented with moving right (Turn 55, Turn 56) and up-and-right (Turn 59) to circumvent obstacles and explore new areas within the tall grass.
*   **Stuck in loop?** The player seemed to be in an infinite loop between (0,8) and (1,9).

**Key Discoveries/Insights:**

*   **Route 1 Habitat:** Tall grass on Route 1 is confirmed as a likely habitat for wild Pokémon, supporting the player's chosen exploration strategy.
*   **Navigational Challenges:** Route 1's terrain includes ledges and fences that restrict movement and require strategic planning.
*   **Ineffective Northward Movement:** Moving straight up may be ineffective or result in cyclical movement due to the presence of obstacles like ledges and fences.
*   **Position Tracking:** The game logs the player's (x, y) coordinates, providing the possibility to avoid redundant movements or map out effective paths.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Prioritize Battle Encounters:** Continue exploring tall grass patches to trigger battles and gain experience.
2.  **Optimize Pathfinding:** Implement a strategy to avoid repeating movements and stuck position loops.
3.  **Explore Rightward Path:** Focus exploration on the right side of the current location (Route 1) to overcome the northern obstacles and discover new areas.
4.  **Map Exploration:** Begin mentally mapping the area, noting ledge and fence locations, to improve navigation and encounter efficiency.
5.  **Document Encountered Pokémon:** Note any Pokémon encountered, their levels, and move sets for future strategic planning.
