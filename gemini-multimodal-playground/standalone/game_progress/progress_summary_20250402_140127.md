# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Expedition

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest, in tall grass.
*   **Lead Pokémon HP:** 26/29
*   **Current Objective:** Encounter and catch a Pikachu.

## Recent Actions (Turns 15-24)

Our primary activity in the last ten turns involved navigating Viridian Forest in search of a wild Pikachu. The turns started with clearing battle summary screens from previous encounters, pressing `A` to proceed through the text.

Once out of the battle summary, we found ourselves outside the tall grass and focused on re-entering it. Multiple `left` commands were issued to move back into the tall grass, where wild Pokémon encounters are more frequent.

After re-entering the tall grass on turn 21, we explored the area with movements `up`, `right`, `down` on turn 21. Starting on turn 22, we encountered a series of battles with Caterpie, all of which were addressed by selecting the "Fight" option and then using the first available move (pressing `A` then `A`).

## Key Discoveries and Observations

*   **Confirmed Spawns:** Caterpie is a common encounter in the tall grass of Viridian Forest. Pidgey was also encountered earlier.
*   **Location Navigation:** The environment is complex and movement is sometimes required to just get back into the tall grass to find wild pokemon
*   **HP Status:** Our lead Pokémon's HP is holding steady, indicating that battles fought have been relatively harmless.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Pikachu Elusiveness:** Despite dedicated exploration, a Pikachu has yet to be encountered.
*   **Repetitive Encounters:** Frequent battles with Caterpie are slowing down progress toward finding a Pikachu.
*   **Initial Positioning:** We were initially placed outside the tall grass after previous battles, requiring several moves to re-enter the optimal hunting area.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Exploring Viridian Forest:** Remain in the tall grass and continue to move around to trigger more wild Pokémon encounters.
2.  **Prioritize Pikachu Encounters:** Once a Pikachu is found, switch strategy to catching instead of battling until faint.
3.  **Inventory Check:** It is recommended to check the inventory for Poké Balls and other useful items for catching Pokémon.
4.  **Monitor Lead Pokémon HP:** Closely monitor the HP of the lead Pokémon, and consider healing options if the Pokémon's HP drops to low levels. If it gets too low, consider returning to the Pokémon Center to heal.
