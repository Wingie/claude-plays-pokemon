# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** In battle with a Kakuna.
*   **Active Pokémon:** Mankey
*   **Mankey's HP:** 20/26
*   **Battle Status:** Ongoing battle against Kakuna.

## Recent Actions (Turns 65-74)

The primary focus has been battling a Kakuna with Mankey. The strategy has involved repeatedly using the "SCRATCH" move. The player consistently selects "FIGHT" from the battle menu and then chooses "SCRATCH" as the attack. The battle is ongoing and the need to press "A" is a recurring action between attack selections.

*   **Turn 65:** Used "SCRATCH" against Kakuna.
*   **Turn 66:** Selected "FIGHT" in the battle menu.
*   **Turn 67:** Selected "SCRATCH" as the move.
*   **Turn 68:** Used "SCRATCH" against Kakuna.
*   **Turn 69:** Used "SCRATCH" against Kakuna.
*   **Turn 70:** Selected "FIGHT" in the battle menu.
*   **Turn 71:** Selected "SCRATCH" as the move.
*   **Turn 72:** Used "SCRATCH" against Kakuna.
*   **Turn 73:** Used "SCRATCH" against Kakuna.
*   **Turn 74:** Selected "FIGHT" in the battle menu.

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Persistent Enemy:** The Kakuna battle has been ongoing for at least 10 turns, suggesting Kakuna may have high defense or Mankey's "SCRATCH" is not very effective against it.
*   **PP Consumption:** The PP for Scratch has decreased from 30/35 to 29/35, showing a limited amount of uses for this move.
*   **Repetitive Gameplay:** The gameplay loop currently consists of selecting "FIGHT," choosing "SCRATCH," and confirming the action repeatedly.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Prolonged Battle:** The battle with Kakuna is taking longer than expected, potentially due to type matchups or Kakuna's defensive stats. The player's current strategy might not be the most efficient.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue the Battle:** Persist in defeating the Kakuna, unless Mankey's HP gets critically low.
2.  **Evaluate Strategy:** If the battle continues to be drawn out, consider using "LOW KICK" instead of "SCRATCH" to determine if a different attack is more effective.
3.  **Monitor Mankey's HP:** Keep a close eye on Mankey's HP and consider using a Potion if it gets too low to avoid a knockout.
4.  **Consider "RUN":** If the battle is unwinnable, strategically "RUN" from the battle.
