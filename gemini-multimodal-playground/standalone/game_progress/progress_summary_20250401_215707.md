# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Assumed based on "recent" nature)

## Current Status

Currently engaged in a battle, attempting to select Charamander to continue. Progress has been stalled due to confusion navigating the Pokémon selection and information screens. The primary goal remains reaching the Poké Mart with a blue roof in Viridian City.

## Recent Actions (Turns 80-89)

The last ten turns have been almost entirely focused on attempting to select Charamander during a battle. The sequence involved repeatedly:

*   Accessing Charamander's information screen.
*   Incorrectly attempting to select Charamander directly from this screen using 'A'.
*   Correctly using 'B' or selecting "CANCEL" to exit the information screen, presumably to return to the main battle menu.
*   Repeating the process.

The selection process has been unexpectedly difficult, possibly due to player error or an unintuitive user interface.

## Key Discoveries

*   **User Interface Challenge:** The player is struggling to correctly select a Pokémon from the party during battle, specifically Charamander. The "SUMMARY" option on the Pokemon info screen is adding to the confusion.
*   **No Forward Progress:**  No progress has been made towards the primary objective of reaching Viridian City. All recent actions have been within the confines of a single battle selection screen.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Successfully select Charamander:** The immediate priority is to correctly select Charamander to continue the current battle. The player needs to identify the correct method of choosing the Pokemon, whether it involves an initial selection screen *before* pressing 'A' on the Pokémon's info page, or a different selection mechanic altogether.
2.  **Resume travel to Viridian City:** Once the battle selection issue is resolved, the player should immediately resume their journey north towards Viridian City.
3.  **Locate the Poké Mart:** Upon arriving in Viridian City, the player must find the Poké Mart with the blue roof as their primary destination.
4.  **Consider alternative battle strategies:** If Charamander is repeatedly difficult to select, the player should consider developing an alternative plan to proceed in the game.
