# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on context, assumed today's date)

**Current Status:**

*   Currently in Viridian Forest.
*   Engaged in leveling up Pokémon through wild battles.
*   Recently battled a Rattata, with Pikachu using Thundershock.
*   Pikachu's current HP: 14/20

**Recent Actions:**

*   Initial turns focused on navigating through Viridian Forest towards tall grass to initiate wild Pokémon encounters.
*   Repeated attempts to move to coordinates (8,5). (Appears to be stuck at the same location).
*   Engaged in a battle with a Rattata.
*   Repeatedly pressed 'A' to advance the dialog after Pikachu used Thundershock.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Successfully entered a battle state.
*   Discovered that advancing dialog during battle requires pressing 'A'.
*   Confirmed that wild Rattata appear in Viridian Forest.
*   Discovered Pikachu has access to Thundershock and it is used during battle.

**Challenges:**

*   **Navigation Issue:** The protagonist seems to be stuck at coordinate (8,5) despite attempting to move right. This suggests either a game mechanic is preventing movement, or the movement commands are not being executed correctly.
*   **Repetitive Actions:** Repeatedly pressing A to advance dialog while not progressing. Suggests an issue of responsiveness or lag in the game or the bot controller.
*   **Taking damage**: Pikachu at 14/20 HP indicates it received damage in a previous turn of combat.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Troubleshoot Navigation:** Investigate why the protagonist is stuck at coordinates (8,5). Explore alternative movement strategies (e.g., moving up, down, left). If navigation is impossible in the current location, determine if escaping the area is an option.
2.  **Ensure Battle Progression:** Determine if there is a failure or bug preventing proper dialog from advancing when pressing 'A' and correct any fault.
3.  **Monitor Pikachu's Health:** Pay close attention to Pikachu's health during battles to avoid fainting. Potentially use a Potion if available.
4.  **Continue Leveling:** Once navigation and battle progression are resolved, continue battling wild Pokémon in Viridian Forest to level up the team. Target a level range appropriate for exiting the forest.

**Strategic Considerations:**

*   Due to navigation issues, a detailed plan is needed for exploring Viridian Forest. Create a map or remember landmarks.
*   Keep track of the type matchups for the team. Pikachu's Thundershock is super effective against Water and Flying type Pokémon.
