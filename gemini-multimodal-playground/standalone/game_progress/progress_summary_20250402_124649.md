# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian City
*   **Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.
*   **Party:**
    *   Pidgey: Level 5, HP 7/19 (Low Health)

## II. Recent Actions

*   **Battles:** Successfully defeated one wild Ratata.
*   **Exploration:**
    *   Explored tall grass areas, triggering wild encounters.
    *   Reached Viridian City and began exploring its layout.
    *   Identified a potential PokéCenter in Viridian City.
*   **Interaction:** About to interact with an NPC in Viridian City.

## III. Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Battle Mechanics:** While rudimentary, the basic attack command seems to be effective against low-level Pokémon like Ratata.
*   **Low HP:** Pidgey's low HP (7/19) after the Ratata battle is a concern and highlights the need for healing soon.
*   **Viridian City:** Reached the first city and identified potential key locations (PokéCenter). Understanding the city's layout will be crucial for further progression.
*   **Overworld Encounters:** Tall grass consistently triggers encounters with wild Pokémon.
*   **The need to heal:** Healing Pidgey's HP is a priority.

## IV. Next Objectives

*   **Heal Pidgey:** Locate and utilize the PokéCenter in Viridian City to restore Pidgey's HP.
*   **Explore Viridian City:** Thoroughly explore Viridian City to identify potential trainers for battles and learn more about the game world.
*   **NPC Interaction:** Engage in dialogue with the NPC in Viridian City to potentially receive quests, information, or items.
*   **Continue Training:** Seek out more battles (after healing) to further train Pidgey and learn effective strategies. Consider exploring other areas outside of Viridian City after exploration within the city.
*   **Prioritize Survival:** Carefully manage Pidgey's HP and avoid unnecessary risks, given its current low health.

## V. Challenges & Strategies

*   **Challenge:** Pidgey's low HP after the first battle poses a significant challenge. Continuing battles in this state risks fainting and potential setbacks.
*   **Strategy:** The immediate priority is to heal Pidgey. Then, focus on targeted training battles, selecting weaker opponents to gain experience without risking further damage. Interacting with NPCs may reveal safer training locations or strategies.
