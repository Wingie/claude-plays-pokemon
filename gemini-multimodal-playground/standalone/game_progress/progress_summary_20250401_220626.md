*   Re-entered battle against a Rattata with Charmander.

## Key Discoveries and Challenges

*   **Repetitive Screen Errors:** Significant difficulty experienced in exiting the Pokémon information and selection screens during battle. Likely caused by control confusion or input errors.
*   **Battle Re-Engagement:** Despite the navigation difficulties, the player has re-entered the battle with the Rattata.
*   **Charmander's HP:** Charmander's health is below maximum, indicating damage taken in the battle.
