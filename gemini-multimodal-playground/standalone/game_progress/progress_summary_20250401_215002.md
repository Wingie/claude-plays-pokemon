# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Locate the PokéMart with a blue roof in Viridian City.

**Current Status:**

*   **Location:** Currently in an overworld area, seemingly at the southern edge of Viridian City or a connected area.
*   **Orientation:** Facing north.
*   **Progression:** Making slow but steady progress northwards, navigating a path surrounded by trees and fences.

**Recent Actions & Analysis (Turns 0-9):**

*   **Initial Assessment (Turn 0-5):** Initial assumption was that the starting location was Viridian City. An attempt to move directly north was repeatedly blocked by a fence at position (4,0).
*   **Obstacle Encountered (Turn 5):** A fence was identified as blocking northward progress.
*   **Course Correction (Turn 5-9):** Changed strategy. An attempt was made to circumvent the fence by moving right and then up. Continues to move north.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   **Initial Location:** Confirmed to be an area with a path heading north, but not immediately in the center of Viridian City.
*   **Obstacles:** The presence of fences necessitates careful navigation and pathfinding.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Continue Northward Movement:** Prioritize continuing along the visible path north to penetrate further into Viridian City.
2.  **Identify Landmarks:** Look for distinctive buildings, signs, or other landmarks that can help confirm the location within Viridian City. Pay special attention to building roof colors.
3.  **Adapt Strategy as Needed:** Be prepared to alter course if the current path leads to another dead end. Consider exploring east or west to find alternative routes.
