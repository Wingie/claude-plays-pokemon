# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Route 2 (Coordinates: 7, 5)
*   **Lead Pokémon HP:** Full (24/24) - No need for healing.
*   **Battle Status:** Currently stuck in an endless battle loop, or mistakenly perceiving battles when in the menu.
*   **Poké Balls:** Unknown Count.  This is a problem, as we need them to catch a Pikachu!

## Recent Actions & Analysis

The last several turns have been plagued by confusion and getting stuck in either the menu or a perceived battle state:

*   **Turns 6-8:** Mistakenly identified as being in the Pokémon menu. Plan was to exit the menu with 'B' and head towards Viridian Forest. It's unclear if this was ever executed successfully.
*   **Turns 9-15:** Mistakenly identified as being in battle with a Rattata. The plan has been to "Select Fight" and use the first move repeatedly. This suggests we are unable to escape the battle, potentially due to incorrect input or a game state error.

**Key Issues:**

*   **Menu Confusion:** Incorrectly identifying the current screen type (menu vs. overworld vs. battle) is the primary obstacle.
*   **Stuck in Battle:** Repeatedly encountering battles and being unable to resolve them.
*   **Unknown Resources:**  We do not know how many Poké Balls we have. This will be critical when we find a Pikachu.
*   **Progress Stalled:** The repeated battle and menu confusion have prevented us from advancing towards Viridian Forest.

## Key Discoveries

*   The game is consistently misinterpreting the current screen state. This requires a fundamental change in strategy to address.
*   Battles are occurring frequently on Route 2, but we are not progressing through them.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Address Screen State Misinterpretation:** The immediate priority is to reliably identify and react to the current screen state (menu, overworld, battle). We need to use visual cues from the screen to confirm if we are actually in the state that is recorded.
2.  **Escape Battle Loop (If Applicable):**  If we are truly stuck in a battle, explore different options to escape.
    *   **Confirm opponent Pokemon**
    *   **Confirm moves available.**
    *   **Attempt "Run" command if available.**
    *   **Consider forfeiting if possible (unlikely at this stage).**
3.  **If in Menu, Exit:** Use the 'B' button to exit the menu, even if the system thinks we are in battle.
4.  **If in Overworld, Navigate to Viridian Forest:** After reliably being in the overworld, move up to enter Viridian Forest to commence Pikachu hunting.
5.  **Verify Poké Ball Count:** Before actively seeking out Pikachu, visit a Poké Mart or use a menu command (if known) to determine the current Poké Ball count. If we have zero, we will need to buy some first. This may require a return trip to Pallet Town and another conversation with Professor Oak.
