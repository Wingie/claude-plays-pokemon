# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Current Goal:** Level up Pikachu

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Stuck in Battle (Error State)
*   **Party Leader:** Pikachu
*   **Pikachu's HP:** 14/20 (Needs Healing)
*   **Battle Status:** Bugged; currently stuck on move selection screen after defeating a wild Caterpie.

## Recent Actions (Turns 90-99)

The last ten turns have been spent attempting to resolve a bug in the battle system. We are stuck on the move selection screen even though the opponent (Caterpie) has fainted. The current action being repeated is pressing the "A" button in an attempt to advance the dialog and exit the battle. This action has not been successful in resolving the issue.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Bug Encountered:** The game is experiencing a bug that prevents proper battle completion. The move selection screen remains active even after the opposing Pokémon has fainted.
*   **Healing Required:** Pikachu's HP is at 14/20, making healing a priority as soon as the battle bug is resolved.
*   **Ineffective Strategy:** Repeatedly pressing "A" has not resolved the bug, suggesting the need for a different approach.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Battle System Bug:** The primary challenge is the battle system bug, preventing progression and hindering the level-up objective.
*   **Low Pikachu HP:** Pikachu's low HP adds urgency to resolving the bug and seeking healing.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Escape Battle Loop:** Identify a strategy to escape the stuck battle. This could involve:
    *   Trying other button inputs.
    *   If available, attempting to flee the battle even after the opponent is defeated.
    *   Investigating if resetting the game state resolves the issue (last resort).
2.  **Heal Pikachu:** Once the battle bug is resolved, immediately prioritize healing Pikachu at a Pokémon Center.
3.  **Resume Leveling:** After healing, return to the original goal of finding battles to level up Pikachu. If the bug persists, consider alternate leveling locations or strategies.

## Additional Notes

The repeated observation-analysis-plan-act structure of the previous turns highlights the persistence of the bug and the consistent, but ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to resolve it using the same action. Further investigation into potential solutions is required.
