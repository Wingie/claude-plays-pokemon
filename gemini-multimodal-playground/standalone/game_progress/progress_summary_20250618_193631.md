# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Level up Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Stuck in a battle loop.
*   **Party:**
    *   Pikachu: HP 14/20.
*   **Objective Status:** Unable to progress due to a persistent bug.

## Recent Actions (Turns 55-64)

The game has encountered a bug. After defeating a Wild CATERPIE, the game fails to advance past the move selection screen. The loop consists of:

1.  Identifying the screen as the move selection screen in battle.
2.  Recognizing that the opponent (CATERPIE) has fainted.
3.  Acknowledging that Pikachu needs healing (HP 14/20).
4.  Planning to press "A" to advance the dialog and exit the battle.
5.  Executing (presumably) pressing "A," which results in the same screen repeating.

This process has been repeated for ten turns (55-64) with no progress.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Bug Encounter:**  A significant bug is preventing the game from advancing after a battle victory against a CATERPIE. The battle sequence does not properly conclude, leaving the player stuck in a move selection loop.
*   **Pikachu's HP:** Pikachu's HP is consistently low (14/20), reinforcing the need for healing once the battle loop is resolved.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Break the Loop:** Identify a way to circumvent the bug. Potential strategies (untested due to the loop):
    *   Attempting to select a move (though this is unlikely to work).
    *   Restarting the emulator/game (if possible within the current environment).
    *   Investigate for common solutions to this particular FireRed/LeafGreen bug.
2.  **Heal Pikachu:** Once the loop is broken, the immediate priority is to heal Pikachu at the nearest Pokémon Center.
3.  **Resume Leveling:** After healing, continue the primary objective of finding battles to level up Pikachu. Explore areas with low-level Pokémon suitable for training.
4.  **Bug Mitigation:** If this bug persists, investigate ways to avoid triggering it, such as avoiding battles with specific Pokémon (e.g., CATERPIE) or saving frequently.

## Insights & Challenges

*   **Progress Stalled:** The encountered bug is a major obstacle, completely halting progress.
*   **Strategy Limitations:**  The automated nature of the gameplay is constrained by the inability to manually intervene and test alternative actions outside the defined plan.
*   **Need for Robust Error Handling:** The AI needs to be able to detect infinite loops of this nature and trigger a reset or a more general error handling routine.
