# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore the area and catch Pokémon.

**Current Status:** Exiting the shop.

## Recent Actions (Turns 30-39)

This series of turns has been primarily focused on navigating the shop and acquiring items. The main actions can be summarized as follows:

*   **Turn 30:** Initially entered the shop but didn't purchase anything, opting to "CANCEL".
*   **Turn 31:** Purchased an Antidote, and started attempting to exit the shop
*   **Turn 32:** Decided to buy Potions.
*   **Turns 33-39:** Purchased at least one Potion and have been repeatedly attempting to exit the shop after each purchase. The repeated prompts from the shopkeeper ("Please come again!") indicate that we are still inside the shop on turn 39.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Shop Inventory:** The shop stocks POKE BALLs, POTIONs, ANTIDOTEs, and PARLYZ HEALs.
*   **Potion Acquisition:** Potions have been successfully purchased.
* **Shop Exit Persistence:** Exiting the shop is proving to be more difficult than anticipated.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Shop Exit Loop:** Difficulty exiting the shop after making a purchase. The player appears to be stuck in a loop where they keep re-engaging with the shopkeeper.
*   **Item Management:** Although items were purchased, the specific number and use cases for Antidote and Potions have not been outlined yet.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Successfully Exit the Shop:** The immediate priority is to successfully navigate out of the shop environment. This might require a different input sequence than what is currently being attempted.
2.  **Begin Exploration:** Once outside the shop, resume exploring the surrounding area to discover new locations and Pokémon.
3.  **Pokémon Catching:** Begin the process of attempting to catch wild Pokémon to expand the team and gain experience.
