# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Report Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on recent game turns)

**Current Goal:** Navigate to the Viridian City Poké Mart (blue roof).

## Current Status

The player is currently located at position (5, 9) in the overworld. A sign is positioned directly north, presenting an immediate navigational obstacle. The player is repeatedly attempting to circumvent the sign.

## Recent Actions (Turns 30-39)

The primary activity during the last 10 turns has been attempting to bypass a sign located directly north of the player's starting position (5, 9). The player has experimented primarily with two strategies:

*   **Strategy 1:** Left, Up, Right (and variations thereof) - Consistently unsuccessful.
*   **Strategy 2:** Right, Up, Left - Repeatedly attempted, also unsuccessful.

A brief change in position to (2, 9) occurred in Turn 35, suggesting the initial direction of 'right' moved us elsewhere briefly, before finding ourselves back at (5,9).

## Key Discoveries

*   **Obstacle:** The sign north of position (5, 9) is blocking direct northward progress.
*   **Looping Behavior:** The player is seemingly stuck in a loop, unable to effectively navigate around the sign using the attempted strategies. It seems the right direction moves us briefly away, before returning us to position (5,9).
*   **Ineffective Strategies:** Both "Left, Up, Right" and "Right, Up, Left" approaches have failed to bypass the sign. It's likely there are hidden mechanics preventing movement as intended, or that additional actions are required.
*   **X,Y Coordinates** It seems we are getting close to the sign but unable to bypass this without some other action

## Next Objectives

Given the persistent failure to navigate around the sign, the following actions are recommended:

1.  **Re-evaluate Assumptions:**  Consider whether the sign needs to be bypassed at all. Is it possible to interact with the sign or surrounding environment in a way that opens a new path? Are there any hidden tiles or interactable objects we are overlooking?
2.  **Explore Alternate Routes:**  Instead of focusing solely on immediate movements around the sign, explore further east and west to identify alternative paths north.
3.  **Experiment with Item Usage:** Although unlikely at this early stage, consider if any available items might influence movement or interaction with the environment.
4.  **Consult External Resources:** If the problem persists, consult online resources (walkthroughs, forums) to determine the proper path and avoid further stagnation.
5.  **Debug/Log Actions:** Implement a more precise logging mechanism. In future turns, log *every* individual movement command (e.g., "Move Right," "Move Up") instead of just general strategies. This will allow for a more granular analysis of the player's actions and identify potential points of error. This also applies to game environment.
