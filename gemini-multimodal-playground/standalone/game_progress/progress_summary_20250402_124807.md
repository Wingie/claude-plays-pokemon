# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Gain combat experience and learn battle mechanics.

## Current Status

We are currently engaged in multiple battles against wild Rattata to fulfill our primary goal of learning how to fight. Pidgey's HP is consistently full (19/19), indicating we are taking minimal damage, or that the battles are consistently ending with full HP for Pidgey. Pidgey has also experienced defense boosts in some battles.

## Recent Actions (Turns 25-34)

*   **Repeatedly engaged in battles with wild Rattata.** Each turn primarily involves encountering a Rattata and selecting the first attack option, presumably "Tackle."
*   **Observed Pidgey's status changes during battle.** We've witnessed Pidgey's defense rising in some instances.
*   **Encountered a missed attack.** Pidgey's attack missed during one turn (Turn 29).

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Rattata are prevalent:** The game world in our current location seems to have a high encounter rate for Rattata.
*   **Tackle is the default strategy:** Our consistent use of the first attack option ("Tackle") suggests it's our primary offensive move currently.
*   **Status effects are present:** We've observed Pidgey's defense stat being boosted during battles. This confirms the presence of stat-altering effects in combat.
*   **Move accuracy is a factor:** Pidgey's missed attack highlights the importance of move accuracy in battles.

## Challenges & Obstacles

*   **Repetitive gameplay:** The constant encounters with Rattata and reliance on a single attack move may lead to slow progress and a lack of diverse combat experience.
*   **Missed attacks:** The possibility of missed attacks can hinder our progress and extend battle duration.

## Next Objectives

*   **Continue battling wild Pokémon:** Focus on maximizing battle experience, especially with Rattata being so common.
*   **Explore available moves:** Investigate Pidgey's available moves and consider diversifying our attack strategy beyond "Tackle". Check the stats and effects of other potentially available moves.
*   **Identify other wild Pokémon:** Venture into different areas to encounter a wider variety of wild Pokémon and gain experience against different types.
*   **Evaluate battle effectiveness:** Monitor the effectiveness of "Tackle" against different Pokémon and consider adjusting our strategy based on enemy types and Pidgey's stats.
*   **Address missed attacks:** Investigate if there are ways to improve attack accuracy (e.g., through items or abilities).
