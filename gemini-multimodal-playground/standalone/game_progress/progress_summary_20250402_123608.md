# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 90-99

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

Our Pidgey is consistently fainting in battles, forcing us to switch to our Charmander. Charmander remains at a healthy 29/29 HP. We are frequently on the "Choose a POKéMON" screen.

## Recent Actions

*   **Repeatedly selected Charmander after Pidgey fainted.** Across the past ten turns, the primary action has been selecting Charmander as our active Pokémon after Pidgey has fainted. The selection is consistently made by pressing 'A' on the "Choose a POKéMON" screen.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Pidgey is underperforming.** Pidgey is consistently fainting in battles, indicating it's either under-leveled or facing unfavorable matchups.
*   **Charmander is our reliable backup.** Charmander remains healthy and ready to battle, making it a dependable choice after Pidgey faints.
*   **"Choose a POKéMON" Screen:** We are becoming intimately familiar with the "Choose a POKéMON" screen and the process of selecting a Pokémon after one faints.

## Challenges

*   **Pidgey's vulnerability:** The consistent fainting of Pidgey indicates a significant weakness that needs to be addressed. This could be due to type matchups, low level, or poor stats.
*   **Lack of Battle Progression:** The report only describes changing Pokémon instead of fighting so there is no progress towards the goal of "find battles to win".

## Next Objectives

1.  **Investigate why Pidgey is fainting.** Determine the cause of Pidgey's weakness and consider options such as:
    *   Training Pidgey in easier areas.
    *   Evaluating Pidgey's moveset and stats.
    *   Considering replacing Pidgey if necessary.
2.  **Engage Charmander in battle.** Now that Charmander is consistently being sent out, it's time to strategically utilize its moves and gain experience.
3.  **Find Easier Battles:** The current battles appear too difficult for our current Pokémon levels. Look for easier fights.
4.  **Focus on Training and Leveling:** Dedicate some time to grinding experience and leveling up both Pidgey and Charmander to improve their battle effectiveness.

## Strategic Notes

*   We need to shift our focus from simply switching Pokémon to actively battling and gaining experience.
*   Prioritize understanding type matchups and move effectiveness to make informed decisions in battle.
*   Consider exploring different areas to find battles that are better suited to our current Pokémon's levels.
