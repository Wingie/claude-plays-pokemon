# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Lead Pokémon HP: 12/21. Critically low; requires healing.
*   Location: Currently in tall grass, heading towards Viridian City.
*   Primary Objective: Find and win Pokémon battles. (Temporarily suspended due to low health)

**Recent Actions (Turns turn_0 - turn_99):**

*   **Turns 0-4:** Engaged in combat with a wild Pidgey, repeatedly using the "Scratch" attack. The outcome of these battles is not explicitly stated, but we can assume continued battling due to the subsequent low HP.
*   **Turns 95-98:** Realized the critical need for healing due to low HP. Initiated a plan to travel to the Viridian City Pokémon Center. Initially, the direction of the Pokémon Center was unknown, leading to an assumption to move left.
*   **Turn 96-97:** Attempted to move down to leave the tall grass and progress towards the Pokémon Center.
*   **Turn 98:** Explicitly set a flag `needs_healing = True` (inferred) and reiterated the need to move towards the Pokémon Center.
*   **Turn 99:** Encountered another wild Pidgey battle, interrupting the journey to the Pokémon Center. The battle strategy is to select FIGHT and use the first move (likely Scratch).

**Key Discoveries/Insights:**

*   **The Danger of Tall Grass:** Continues to be a frequent battle trigger, interrupting travel and potentially further depleting HP.
*   **Healing is Critical:** Recognised the importance of maintaining adequate HP, and the need to visit Pokemon Centers to heal.
*   **Uncertainty of Navigation:** Faced navigational challenges due to unfamiliarity with the location of Viridian City and its Pokémon Center. Initial movement was based on assumption rather than precise knowledge.
*   **Pidgeys Abound:** Pidgeys appear to be a very common wild Pokémon in the area.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Prioritize Healing:** The immediate priority is to reach the Viridian City Pokémon Center and heal the lead Pokémon.
2.  **Navigate Effectively:** Need to determine the correct route to the Pokémon Center. If current leftward movement proves incorrect, adjust accordingly.
3.  **Manage Wild Encounters:** Develop a strategy to minimize unwanted wild Pokémon encounters while traveling, potentially by avoiding tall grass or using Repels (if available).
4.  **Resume Training:** Once the lead Pokémon is healed, resume the primary objective of finding and winning Pokémon battles to gain experience and progress through the game.

**Concerns:**

*   Continued wild encounters while trying to reach the Pokémon Center could lead to fainting, resulting in a setback.
*   Lack of specific knowledge about the game world and optimal routes may hinder progress.

**Proposed Strategies:**

*   **Explore Alternatives to Tall Grass:** Attempt to find a path that avoids tall grass to minimize wild encounters.
*   **Consider Potions (if available):** If Potions are available, use them to restore HP and potentially delay the need to visit the Pokémon Center immediately.
*   **Record and Learn:** Pay close attention to the map and surroundings to improve navigation and memory of the game world.
