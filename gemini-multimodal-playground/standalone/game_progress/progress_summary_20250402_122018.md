# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on prompt date, assumed)
**Current Goal:** Level up Mankey through battles.

## Current Status

*   Currently attempting to train Mankey to a higher level.
*   Recent attempts to enter battles have been somewhat unreliable, with the game sometimes requiring multiple selections of Mankey to initiate combat.
*   Mankey has recently experienced low health during battle, leading to the need to run.

## Recent Actions (Turns 80-89)

*   Repeatedly engaged in battles against wild Pidgey to train Mankey.
*   Consistently used the "Scratch" attack during battles with Pidgey.
*   Attempted to flee from a battle due to Mankey's low health (Turn 85).
*   Experienced issues with the game not consistently registering Mankey's selection for battle, requiring redundant selections (Turns 86, 87, 88, 89).

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Pidgey is a common wild encounter:** The consistent encounters with Pidgey suggest it's a prevalent Pokémon in the current area.
*   **Mankey's Health is a Concern:** Mankey's low health during battles indicates the need for either a more efficient training strategy, healing items, or a change of location to fight weaker opponents.
*   **Input Issues:** The game is exhibiting inconsistent input recognition, requiring the player to repeat actions (specifically, selecting Mankey). This could be a technical issue (e.g., emulator lag or controller problem) or a quirk of the game itself.
*   **Scratch not enough?** Mankey using scratch did not result in leveling up.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Resolve Input Issues:** Investigate and address the input recognition problems to ensure actions are reliably registered. Possible actions include restarting the game/emulator, checking controller connections/settings, or adjusting emulator settings.
2.  **Prioritize Mankey's Health:** Before continuing intensive training, ensure Mankey's health is managed effectively. This includes:
    *   **Carry and use healing items (Potions):** Purchase potions from a Poké Mart to restore Mankey's health after battles.
    *   **Utilize Pokémon Centers:** If close to one, consistently heal Mankey at a Pokémon Center after battles.
3.  **Evaluate Training Location:** If Pidgey battles are proving too challenging or inefficient, consider exploring other areas with potentially weaker Pokémon to facilitate easier leveling.
4.  **Explore Alternative Attacks:** Determine if Mankey has, or can learn, more effective attacks than Scratch.
