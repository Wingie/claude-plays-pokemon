# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Stuck in a battle loop.
*   **Party:** Pikachu (HP: 14/20)
*   **Battle Status:** Currently in battle with a fainted Wild CATERPIE. The game is bugged and stuck on the move selection screen.
*   **Resources:** Unknown (no visible information about potions or other resources)

## Recent Actions (Turns 90-99)

*   **Repeated Attempt to Exit Battle:** Over the last ten turns, the agent has consistently observed that the game is stuck in a loop after defeating a Wild CATERPIE. The agent correctly identifies the bug and attempts to resolve it by pressing 'A' to advance the dialogue and exit the battle. However, the action has been unsuccessful, and the game remains in the same state.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Identified a Game-Breaking Bug:** The game is experiencing a bug where the battle sequence doesn't progress after defeating a wild CATERPIE, leaving the agent stuck on the move selection screen.
*   **Consistent State:** The game state remains unchanged despite repeated attempts to exit the battle, confirming the persistent nature of the bug.
*   **Pikachu's Low HP:** Pikachu's HP is low (14/20) and requires healing once the battle is exited.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Battle Loop Bug:** The primary challenge is the persistent battle loop bug, preventing further progress.
*   **Potential HP Depletion:** Remaining in the battle loop poses a risk of HP depletion if the game were to unexpectedly trigger another attack.
*   **Healing Delay:** The inability to exit the battle also prevents the healing of Pikachu.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Attempt to Resolve the Bug:** Continue trying to exit the battle by pressing 'A' in hopes that a future action might trigger the correct response, or if external conditions change that could affect the game state.
2.  **Explore Alternative Bug Fixes:** If the basic "A" press continues to fail, investigate if any other buttons or combination of buttons might help break the loop. A hard reset may be necessary in a real-world scenario.
3.  **Prioritize Healing:** Once the battle is exited, the immediate priority is to heal Pikachu's HP to avoid being easily defeated in the next encounter.
4.  **Resume Original Goal:** Once the bug is resolved and Pikachu is healed, resume finding and winning Pokémon battles to progress in the game.

## Strategic Insights

*   **Stuck State:** The current strategy of simply pressing 'A' is not working, and a different approach is needed to escape the bug.
*   **Importance of Healing:** Low HP makes Pikachu vulnerable, highlighting the importance of healing after battles.
*   **Bug Handling:** Future strategies will need to account for the possibility of encountering more bugs and having contingency plans to address them.
