# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:** Actively engaged in battles and focused on learning the basics of combat.

**Recent Actions (Turns 80-89):**

*   **Exploration (Turns 80-81):** Initially stuck in a loop moving upwards on a path near tall grass (location 2, 11). Recognized the need to change direction and successfully entered the tall grass to initiate encounters.
*   **Battle Engagement (Turns 82-89):** Consistently engaging in battles. A key strategy has emerged: selecting the first attack option, presumably the strongest available move, identified as "Tackle" in some turns.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   **Battle Initiation:** Tall grass is a reliable source of wild Pokémon battles.
*   **Basic Combat Strategy:** The "Tackle" attack (or the first attack option) is the preferred method for dealing damage in current battles.
* **Location awareness:** The current location is a path with tall grass and trees, and the path initially leads upwards.

**Challenges:**

*   **Initial Navigation Loop:** Experiencing difficulty navigating the overworld, demonstrated by being stuck moving upwards repeatedly. This was overcome by changing direction.
*   **Lack of Attack Variety:** The report shows us using the same attack in battle over and over. We are learning the basics of combat, but are relying on Tackle alone.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Continue Battle Practice:** Maintain the current focus on engaging in battles to gain experience and learn more about the combat mechanics.
2.  **Evaluate Attack Effectiveness:** Begin to observe the effectiveness of "Tackle" against different opponents.
3.  **Explore Alternate Attack Options:** Once comfortable with the basic attack, start experimenting with other attack options to learn their effects and strategic advantages.
4.  **Overworld Navigation:** Continue to explore the area surrounding the initial location (2, 11) after battles to discover new areas and potential challenges.

**Summary:**

The recent turns have been focused on initiating battles and learning how to fight, with a general strategy of using "Tackle" as the primary attack. While initial exploration proved slightly challenging, entering the tall grass resolved this issue and led to immediate battle engagement. The next steps will be to diversify combat tactics and continue exploring the surrounding environment.
