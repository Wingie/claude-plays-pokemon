# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** (4, 7), Currently in Battle
*   **Party Leader:** Pidgey (Level 12, 31/33 HP)
*   **State:** Repeatedly encountering Caterpie.

## Recent Actions (Turns 30-39)

The past ten turns have been dominated by a series of battles against Caterpie. Each turn follows the same pattern:

1.  **Encounter:** Initiated a battle.
2.  **Assessment:** Confirmed the opponent is a Caterpie. Verified Pidgey's level and health.
3.  **Action:** Selected "Fight" and then "Tackle."

## Key Discoveries

*   **High Caterpie Encounter Rate:** The dominant species encountered at location (4, 7) appears to be Caterpie.
*   **Tactical Stalemate:** Continually using Tackle against Caterpie. No other Pokémon have been encountered.

## Challenges

*   **Monotony:** Encounters are consistently with the same Pokémon. This slows down the exploration process and limits opportunities for training or catching new Pokémon.
*   **Lack of Progress:** Despite engaging in multiple battles, we haven't advanced further into Viridian Forest or progressed toward our goal of finding Pikachu.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Vary Tactics:** While Tackle is effective, explore alternate moves (if available) to potentially expedite battles or conserve PP.
2.  **Advance Exploration:** Attempt to move to a new location to potentially encounter different Pokémon or advance deeper into the forest, instead of staying at coordinates (4,7).
3.  **Pikachu Prioritization:** Remember our primary objective: finding a Pikachu. Consider if the current location (4,7) is a Pikachu habitat. If it's not, we need to move. If it is, continue to battle and hope to find one.
