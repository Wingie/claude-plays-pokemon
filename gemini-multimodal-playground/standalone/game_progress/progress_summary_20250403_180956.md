# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up our Pokémon.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently engaged in a battle.
*   **Party:**
    *   Pikachu, Level 5, HP 19/19
*   **Opponent:** Caterpie, Level 4

## Recent Actions

Over the last five turns, we have been repeatedly engaging a wild Caterpie in battle.  The initial action involved entering the battle and navigating to the move selection screen.  Subsequent turns focused on selecting the appropriate move. Initially, without knowledge of Pikachu's move set, the default first move (selected by pressing "A") was chosen. Eventually, we learned Pikachu's moves.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Pikachu's Moves:** Pikachu knows the moves Growl and Thundershock.
*   **Type Effectiveness:**  Thundershock is an Electric-type move.  Electric-type moves are super effective against Bug-type Pokémon, such as Caterpie.
*   **Move Strategy:**  Growl lowers the opponent's attack, which is less immediately useful than an attack move when the primary goal is leveling up.
*   **Battle Consistency:** For several turns, identical battle observation and action sequences occurred, indicating a loop.

## Analysis of Challenges

*   **Repetitive Actions:** The bot appears to be stuck in a loop, repeatedly encountering and battling the same Caterpie.
*   **Move Selection Inconsistency:** There were conflicting selection moves. At first, the decision was to always select move "A" by default. In the next turns, Thundershock move was prioritised.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Prioritize Thundershock:** Consistently select Thundershock to exploit Caterpie's weakness and expedite the battle.
2.  **Break the Loop:** Implement logic to avoid endlessly battling the same Caterpie. This could involve:
    *   Moving to a new area if a certain number of battles have been fought.
    *   Exploring different directions.
    *   Determining victory conditions (e.g., when Caterpie's HP reaches zero).
3.  **Monitor HP:** Integrate HP monitoring into the observation phase to make informed decisions about when to use items or switch Pokémon (once we have more).
4. **Refine Move Selection Logic:** Resolve any conflicts between choosing a move. The bot seems to choose move "A" by default at times, but then prioritizes Thundershock.
