# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore the world to find a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, position (8, 11).
*   **Direction:** Facing North.
*   **Party:** Currently only one Pokémon, HAN (Level 3, 15/15 HP).
*   **Obstacle:** Tall grass directly north blocking forward progress.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turn 35:** Selected initial Pokémon, HAN.
*   **Turn 36:** Encountered a Level 4 Rattata. Attempted to flee the battle successfully.
*   **Turns 37-44:** Repeatedly attempted to navigate north, encountering tall grass that potentially triggers wild Pokémon encounters. Engaged in a dialogue with Gary.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Early Game Encounter:** Faced a Level 4 Rattata, indicating that low-level Pokémon are present in the early routes.
*   **Initial Obstacle:** Tall grass acts as a barrier to exploration, potentially hiding wild Pokémon or new areas.
*   **Early Game NPC:** Encountered and spoke with Gary, a recurring character.

## Challenges

*   **Low-Level Pokémon:** HAN is at a relatively low level (3), making battles potentially risky, especially with wild Pokémon in the tall grass.
*   **Limited Exploration:** The tall grass barrier limits immediate exploration options.
*   **Finding Pikachu:** The current location may not be the optimal location to find Pikachu; further exploration is needed.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Brave the Tall Grass:** Continue moving North into the tall grass to explore beyond it. This is the only apparent path forward from the current location.
2.  **Pokemon Encounters:** Be prepared for wild Pokémon encounters within the tall grass. Consider strategies for catching new Pokémon (once Poké Balls are acquired) or safely fleeing battles if necessary.
3.  **Inventory Management:** As soon as possible, acquire Poké Balls to catch new Pokémon, and other items to aid in exploration and battle.
4.  **Explore Different Routes:** Once the tall grass is traversed, assess the new area and explore available paths to broaden the search for Pikachu.
