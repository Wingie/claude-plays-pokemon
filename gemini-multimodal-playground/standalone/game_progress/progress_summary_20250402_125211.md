# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, Coordinates (2, 11)
*   **Environment:** Path bordered by tall grass (left) and trees (right).
*   **Pokémon:** Pidgey is currently at Level 7.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turn 70-73:** Fought in a battle (details unknown), resulting in Pidgey leveling up to Level 7.  Multiple turns spent progressing through the level-up sequence by pressing 'A'.
*   **Turn 74-79:** Systematically moving upwards into the tall grass in hopes of triggering wild Pokémon encounters and subsequent battles.

## Key Discoveries

*   Pidgey has gained levels through battling.
*   Tall grass is suspected to be a location where wild Pokémon encounters occur.
*   The Overworld location provides coordinates for navigation.

## Challenges

*   **Repetitive Level-up Screens:**  The game requires multiple 'A' presses to progress through level-up sequences, which can be time-consuming.
*   **Uncertainty of Encounter Rate:** Moving in tall grass doesn't guarantee immediate battles, leading to potentially lengthy travel segments.

## Next Objectives

*   **Primary:** Continue moving upwards in the tall grass to trigger wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Strategic:** Focus on winning battles to further level up Pidgey.
*   **Secondary:** Identify the types of Pokémon encountered in the tall grass and develop appropriate battle strategies.
