# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and find a Pikachu to catch.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest
*   **Environment:** Primarily in tall grass, occasionally out.
*   **Party Condition:** Lead Pokémon HP is low (22/29) and requires healing.
*   **Overall:** Progress is stalled. We are experiencing difficulty navigating Viridian Forest.

## Recent Actions (Turns 49-59)

The primary action in recent turns has been attempting to navigate out of Viridian Forest to reach the Viridian City Pokémon Center for healing. Initial strategy was to repeatedly move left, based on the assumption that this would lead to the forest exit. This strategy proved ineffective. After multiple attempts and recognizing a loop (Turn 59), the strategy was adjusted to moving down.

*   **Turns 49, 52, 53-58:** Attempted to move left three times each turn.
*   **Turn 50:** Attempted to move down three times.
*   **Turn 59:** Acknowledged being stuck in a loop and switched direction, attempting to move down three times.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Viridian Forest is a maze:** Simple directional movements are not sufficient to exit. Requires more complex pathfinding.
*   **Inaccurate State Tracking:** The AI temporarily suffered from a loop due to not tracking its progress, though it self-corrected this after a while.
*   **Map Absence:** The lack of an in-game map makes navigation more difficult.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Prioritize Healing:** The lead Pokémon's low HP necessitates a trip to the Pokémon Center in Viridian City.
2.  **Revised Navigation Strategy:** The previous directional approach failed. A new strategy is needed:
    *   **Explore thoroughly:** If possible, implement a more comprehensive exploration strategy that avoids repeating the same areas. Perhaps try a different movement pattern like "up, left, down, right" or a random walk until a boundary or exit is found.
    *   **Optimize for Pikachu:** While escaping the forest, continue to engage with tall grass patches, but limit battles if HP is critically low.
3.  **Long-Term Planning:** Once healed, return to Viridian Forest and implement the revised navigation strategy with the primary objective of capturing a Pikachu.

## Insights and Challenges

*   **Navigation Challenges:** Navigating the forest without a map is significantly hindering progress. This necessitates more careful and methodical exploration.
*   **Low HP Risk:** The current low HP of the lead Pokémon makes encountering wild Pokémon risky. Prolonged exploration could lead to a game over if a strong Pokémon is encountered.
*   **Limited Resources:** We currently lack items that could aid navigation or healing within the forest.
