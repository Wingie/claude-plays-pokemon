# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   **Location:** Viridian City Pokémon Center
*   **Lead Pokémon HP:** Currently being healed (was 9/21).
*   **Goal:** To find and win Pokémon battles.
*   **Short-Term Goal:** Fully heal lead Pokémon.

**Recent Actions (Turns 30-39):**

Our strategy has been alternating between battling, attempting to locate more battles, and trying to get to a Pokémon Center for healing when HP drops too low.

*   **Turns 30-33:** Engaged in several Pokémon battles, repeatedly using the first move. We initially sustained damage, bringing our lead Pokémon's HP precariously low.
*   **Turns 33-36:** After winning a battle, the AI made an incorrect assessment of current hp to the point of confusion. It determined that it did not need healing and tried to navigate to another battle. It corrected its logic when finding the lead Pokémon hp was still low.
*   **Turn 37:** Arrived in Viridian City, assessed HP, and made the decision to prioritize the Pokémon Center.
*   **Turn 38-39:** Successfully entered the Pokémon Center and approached the nurse. Currently engaged in dialogue to receive healing.

**Key Discoveries and Insights:**

*   **HP Threshold:** A critical threshold for needing healing was identified as 30% of max HP.
*   **Viridian City Identified:** Confirmed location of Viridian City, the Pokémon Center, and assumed Route 1 is still the destination.
*   **Incorrect State Detection** The state detection has been poor and needs to be adjusted to be more accurate

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Low HP Management:** The constant cycle of battling and then desperately needing to heal is inefficient. A more proactive approach to HP management is needed.
*   **Healing Prioritization:** When HP is low, getting to the Pokémon Center becomes the top priority, overriding the primary goal of battling.
*   **Lack of Environmental Awareness:** The AI lacks spatial awareness.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Complete Healing:** Continue pressing 'A' to finish the healing dialogue in the Pokémon Center.
2.  **Return to Route 1:** Once fully healed, head back to the tall grass on Route 1 to resume battling.
3.  **Improve Battle Strategy:** Consider diversifying attacks beyond just the first move and assessing the opponent's weaknesses.

**Future Considerations:**

*   **Inventory Management:** As we progress, managing potions and other healing items will become increasingly important.
*   **Area Exploration:** Map out the areas we are traversing to better understand the locations of key points, such as the Pokemon Center and the grass.
