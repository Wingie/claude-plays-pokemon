# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Charmander: Level 10, 29/29 HP. Ready for battle.
*   Current Objective: Find battles to win and learn how to fight.
*   Location: Position (2, 11) after recent battle(s).

**Recent Actions:**

*   Engaged in at least one battle with a Pidgey (Lv 3).
*   Successfully defeated a Pidgey using Charmander's "Scratch" attack.
*   Gained 23 EXP. Points for Charmander.
*   Encountered a situation where Pidgey fainted (our Pokémon, not wild Pidgey), requiring Charmander to be selected as the next Pokémon to fight. Repeatedly selected Charmander to send out after Pidgey's defeat.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   "Scratch" is an effective early-game attack for Charmander against low-level Pidgey.
*   Winning battles grants experience points, contributing to Pokémon level progression.
*   When a Pokémon faints, the game prompts to select a replacement Pokémon.
*   The game has a "Choose a POKéMON" screen that prompts the selection of another Pokemon to continue the fight.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   Our own Pidgey apparently fainted, requiring Charmander to be used instead. This indicates a potential weakness in the current team composition or inadequate training of Pidgey.
*   The game appears to be stuck on the "Choose a POKéMON" screen after Pidgey fainted, suggesting a possible error or misunderstanding of the required action. The repeated selection of Charmander indicates a loop.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Break the "Choose a POKéMON" loop:** Investigate why the game is stuck on this screen and take appropriate action to continue the battle or return to the overworld. Perhaps a different action is needed than simply repeatedly selecting Charmander.
2.  **Continue Finding Battles:** After resolving the current issue, actively search for more wild Pokémon to battle and gain experience.
3.  **Evaluate Team Composition:** Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the current team, particularly the reason for Pidgey's fainting. Consider training other Pokémon or exploring different team combinations.
4.  **Learn Different Attacks:** Experiment with other available attacks to understand their effectiveness and coverage against various Pokémon types.
5.  **Strategic Pokemon Selection:** Understand why my Pokemon selection is being requested. Is there more than one pokemon to select?
