# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on "recent" turns provided)

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, near tall grass (presumably Route 1 or similar early-game area).
*   **Pokémon:** Mankey is currently the only Pokémon and has fainted.
*   **Goal:** Level up Mankey through battles.
*   **Immediate State:** Recently returned to the last visited Pokémon Center after Mankey fainted in battle.

## Recent Actions

*   **Initial Phase:** Repeatedly moved into tall grass, attempting to trigger wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Battle Encounter:** Engaged in battle with a Pidgey.
*   **Battle Strategy:** Selected the first (presumably strongest) attack option with Mankey.
*   **Setback:** Mankey fainted during the battle with the Pidgey.
*   **Recovery:** Automatically transported back to the last visited Pokémon Center after Mankey fainted.
*   **Post-Faint:** Navigated dialogue boxes after fainting; currently positioned in the overworld.

## Key Discoveries and Insights

*   **Wild Pokémon Location:** Tall grass is confirmed as a location for encountering wild Pokémon (Pidgey).
*   **Battle Difficulty:** Mankey is currently under-leveled/underpowered, leading to a swift defeat against a Pidgey.
*   **Pokémon Center Functionality:** Fainting results in automatic transportation back to the Pokémon Center, providing a safe haven for healing.
*   **Limited Party:** Currently reliant solely on Mankey. Fainting means going back to the Pokemon Center.
*   **Stamina:** Battles can only last as long as Mankey can last.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Heal Mankey:** Assuming we are at the Pokemon Center.
2.  **Continue Grinding:** Return to the tall grass and actively seek out battles.
3.  **Level Up Mankey:** Focus on gaining experience points to improve Mankey's stats and learn new moves.
4.  **Potential Strategy Adjustment:** If Mankey continues to faint frequently, consider alternative strategies (e.g., carefully choosing attacks, using items when available). If items are not available consider different areas with weaker pokemon.
