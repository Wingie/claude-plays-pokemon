# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Exploring the overworld with the primary goal of encountering a Pikachu.
*   Lead Pokémon: Pidgey, Level 8, 17/25 HP.
*   Not currently in battle.
*   Currently near, but not in, tall grass.

**Recent Actions & Summary:**

The last ten turns (15-24) have primarily involved battling and recovering from a series of encounters with wild Pidgey. The initial turns consisted of repeated battles against the same Pidgey, relying on Tackle as the primary (and seemingly only known) offensive move. The battles resulted in the Pidgey fainting and our Pidgey gaining experience.

After the most recent battle, we exited the encounter and are now in the overworld. The Pidgey has sustained some damage (17/25 HP), but not enough to warrant immediate healing. We are currently not in tall grass.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Our Pidgey currently only knows Tackle and Sand-Attack. Tackle is our go-to offensive move.
*   Pidgey encounters are frequent in the current area.
*   We are getting low on health and should consider using a potion or going to the pokemon center.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Repetitive Battles:** Encountering the same Pokémon repeatedly slows down progress towards finding a Pikachu.
*   **Low HP Management:** Our Pidgey is taking damage in battles. We need to be mindful of its health and when to heal.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Enter Tall Grass:** The immediate priority is to move into the visible tall grass to increase the chance of encountering Pokémon, ideally a Pikachu.
2.  **Continue Pikachu Search:** Explore the area thoroughly, prioritizing areas with tall grass.
3.  **Monitor Pidgey's HP:** Keep a close eye on Pidgey's health and heal when necessary (below 30% HP).
4.  **Expand Move Set:** Once out of battle, find a way to expand Pidgey's move set to handle a wider variety of opponents.
