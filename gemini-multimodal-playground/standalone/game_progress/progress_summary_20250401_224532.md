# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian City, learn how to catch Pokémon.

**Current Status:** Successfully witnessed a Pokémon catching demonstration and have now entered tall grass, ready to apply learned knowledge.

## Recent Actions (Turns 12-29)

*   **Turns 12-21, 23, 25:**  Engaged in an extended dialogue sequence. Repeatedly pressed 'A' to advance the conversation. This involved Professor Oak (presumably) demonstrating how to catch a Pokémon by catching a Weedle.

*   **Turn 20:** Confirmed the successful capture of Weedle during the dialogue.

*   **Turns 26, 29:** Exited the dialogue and entered tall grass. Began exploring, understanding that wild Pokémon encounters are likely in this environment. Initiated movement within the grass (moved up).

## Key Discoveries

*   **Pokémon Catching Tutorial:** Witnessed a successful Pokémon capture by Professor Oak, providing a practical demonstration of the catching mechanics.
*   **Weedle Capture:** Learned about Weedle location.
*   **Tall Grass = Wild Encounters:** Confirmed the function of tall grass as an area where wild Pokémon appear.
*   **Viridian City Exploration:** Beginning exploration of Viridian City vicinity, specifically the tall grass area.

## Challenges & Obstacles

*   **Dialogue Loops:** Significant time spent pressing 'A' to progress through a prolonged dialogue sequence. This "stuck" state slowed down progress.
*   **Uncertainty:** Lack of clear feedback during the dialogue phase (e.g., knowing how many more 'A' presses are needed).

## Next Objectives

1.  **Trigger a Wild Pokémon Encounter:** Continue moving in the tall grass to initiate a battle sequence.
2.  **Apply Learned Catching Techniques:** Attempt to capture a wild Pokémon using the knowledge gained from the Professor Oak demonstration.
3.  **Further Explore Viridian City:** Once a Pokémon has been caught, continue exploring Viridian City to discover new locations, items, and characters.
