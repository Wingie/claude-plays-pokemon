# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, coordinates currently fluctuating between (4, 11) and (7, 5).
*   **Pokémon:** Mankey (HP: 20/26).
*   **Battle Status:** Not currently in battle (`is_in_battle = false`).
*   **Healing Status:** Needs Healing (`needs_healing = true`). Party wiped out.

## Recent Actions (Turns 75-84)

*   **Engaged in multiple battles with Kakuna:** Successfully defeated at least one Kakuna using Mankey's "SCRATCH" attack.
*   **Experienced a party wipe:** All Pokémon fainted, resulting in the text prompt "Huh? I ran out of POKéMON!".
*   **Commenced retreat to Pokémon Center:** Initiated movement towards the Pokémon Center for healing. Currently trying to navigate out of the grassy area.
*   **Repeatedly acknowledged the "out of Pokemon" state:** Turns 80-84 focus on recognizing and responding to the party wipe.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Effectiveness of "SCRATCH" against Kakuna:** The move "SCRATCH" proved sufficient to defeat Kakuna.
*   **Vulnerability of current party:** The party is currently weak and susceptible to fainting, leading to frequent trips back to the Pokémon Center.
*   **Importance of Location Awareness:** Paying attention to coordinates on the map aids navigation back to familiar locations (like the Pokémon Center).
*   **Low HP Threshold:** HP below 30% of max necessitates a return to the Pokemon Center.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Advance Dialogue:** Press 'A' to clear the "out of Pokémon" text prompt.
2.  **Navigate to Pokémon Center:** Successfully navigate out of the current location (likely Viridian Forest) and return to the Pokémon Center for healing. The immediate direction is to move *down* from the current location to exit the grass.
3.  **Heal Pokémon:** Fully restore Pokémon health at the Pokémon Center.
4.  **Re-evaluate Strategy:** Once healed, need to evaluate if the current strategy of battling wild Pokémon is sustainable given the frequent party wipes. Consider alternative training strategies or catching additional Pokémon to build a stronger team.
5.  **Resume Battle Goal:** After healing, continue finding and winning pokemon battles.

## Insights and Considerations

*   The repetitive nature of recent turns (80-84) suggests a potential issue with the movement/navigation logic. Ensure clear instructions are provided for navigating out of the current location.
*   Consider implementing strategies to conserve Pokémon HP and avoid frequent trips back to the Pokémon Center. This could involve:
    *   Using items like potions more strategically.
    *   Switching out Pokémon during battle to avoid taking unnecessary damage.
    *   Targeting weaker opponents for training.
*   The current primary goal to find and win battles is too broad. Refine the goal, perhaps into "Level up Mankey" or "Catch 3 new Pokémon"
