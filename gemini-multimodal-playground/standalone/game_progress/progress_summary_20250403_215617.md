# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Level up Pokémon

## Current Status

Currently battling a Rattata with Pikachu. Pikachu's HP is low at 14/20. We are encountering issues with the game state, specifically getting stuck in loops where the game incorrectly thinks Pikachu is still in battle when we are in the Pokémon selection menu.

## Recent Actions (Turns 40-49)

*   **Turns 40-43:** Attempted to use Thundershock against the Rattata. We appear to have been stuck in a loop, repeatedly trying to select Thundershock.
*   **Turns 44-45:** Realized that Pikachu was low health (17/20) and attempted to switch to Charmander from the Pokémon selection menu. However, the game believed Pikachu was still in battle.
*   **Turns 46-47:** Unable to switch Pokémon as the game state was bugged. Attempted to return to the battle screen by pressing B.
*   **Turns 48-49:** Successfully returned to the battle menu, Pikachu HP at 14/20. Selected "FIGHT".

## Key Discoveries & Challenges

*   **Game State Issues:** We've identified a bug where the game fails to update the state correctly, resulting in being stuck in the Pokémon selection menu while the game thinks Pikachu is still in battle.
*   **Pikachu's Vulnerability:** Pikachu is taking significant damage, necessitating the need for healing or switching Pokémon.
*   **Repetitive Actions:** The AI is prone to getting stuck in loops, requiring intervention and re-analysis of the current situation.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Prioritize Pikachu's Survival:** Continue the battle with Rattata but monitor Pikachu's HP very carefully.
2.  **Address the Game State Bug:** If we enter the Pokémon selection menu again while the game incorrectly thinks Pikachu is in battle, immediately attempt to exit (press B) to reset the state.
3.  **Level Up Other Pokémon:** After the Rattata battle, ensure that we level up other pokemon to reduce the dependance on Pikachu. This will also give us more flexibility during the battles.
4.  **Avoid Loops:** Continuously re-evaluate the situation after each action to prevent the AI from falling into repetitive loops.
5.  **Heal Team:** Ensure the team is healthy before proceeding further into the route.
