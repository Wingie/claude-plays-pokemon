# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:** In battle with a Rattata. Pikachu is the active Pokémon at 14/20 HP.

**Recent Actions (Turns 45-54):**

This series of turns was plagued by issues. Initially, the game appeared to register Pikachu as being "already in battle" while in the Pokémon selection menu, hindering attempts to switch out the low-health Pikachu. This resulted in attempting to return to the battle screen from the party selection menu (turns 46-47). It was stuck in the party screen and not recognizing the button press. It finally returned to the main battle menu and attempted to select the "FIGHT" option repeatedly (turns 48-52). Finally, in turn 53 Pikachu was able to successfully use "THUNDERSHO" and it is now stuck again attempting to progress dialog.

**Key Discoveries/Challenges:**

*   **Game State Issues:** Experiencing potential game state inconsistencies where actions do not properly update the game's status (e.g., Pokémon registered as in battle when not).
*   **Repetitive Actions:** Struggling to avoid repetitive action sequences, indicating a need for more robust state tracking and decision-making.
*   **Pikachu's Low Health:** Pikachu is repeatedly taking damage.
*   **Stuck in Dialog:** After attacking, the system is now caught in a loop attempting to advance dialog.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Finish the Current Battle:** Progress through the battle dialog screens by pressing 'A' until the battle concludes (objective in progress).
2.  **Heal Pikachu:** After the battle, prioritize healing Pikachu's HP. This might involve:
    *   Using a Potion (if available).
    *   Visiting a Pokémon Center.
    *   Switching to a healthier Pokémon (Charmander, Weedle, Mankey, Pidgey) if the current location allows.
3.  **Avoid Game State Errors:** Implement methods to detect when the game state does not match expected conditions (e.g., being stuck in a menu) and implement alternate strategies (e.g. resetting, closing and restarting the game if necessary).
4.  **Resume Leveling:** Return to the primary goal of leveling up the Pokémon team, focusing on battles against appropriate opponents.

**Insights & Strategy:**

*   **Prioritize Pokémon Safety:** Constantly monitor Pokémon HP during battles and be prepared to switch out weakened Pokémon.
*   **Adaptive Decision-Making:** Be ready to adjust strategies based on unpredictable game state changes or unexpected enemy actions.
*   **Troubleshooting Loops:** Create a system that breaks out of repetitive loops based on repeated observations or a lack of progress.
