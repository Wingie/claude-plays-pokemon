# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Report Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest (assumed)
*   **Coordinates:** (8, 5)
*   **Lead Pokémon:** Pikachu (HP: 14/20)
*   **Party Status:**  Pikachu needs healing (HP < 30%).
*   **Battle Status:**  Stuck in a battle loop after defeating a Wild Caterpie. The game has failed to exit the move selection screen.
*   **Exploration:** Initial exploration of Viridian Forest.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 0-4:** Repeated attempts to move upwards in Viridian Forest to encounter Pokémon in the tall grass. No battles initiated successfully during these turns.
*   **Turns 95-99:**  Repeated attempts to exit a battle screen after a Caterpie was defeated. The game appears to be stuck on the move selection screen despite the opponent being defeated. The planned action is to press "A" to try and advance the dialog and exit the battle.

## Key Discoveries and Insights

*   **Location Confirmation:** Confirmed presence in Viridian Forest based on coordinates and environment.
*   **Encounter Rate:** Encounter rate in the tall grass appears low initially.
*   **Battle Bug:** Identified a critical bug where the game fails to exit the battle after defeating a Pokémon, trapping the player in the move selection screen. This requires a work-around to proceed.
*   **Pikachu's Moveset:** Pikachu knows GROWL, THUNDERSHOCK, and TAIL WHIP.
*   **Healing Threshold:** Established a healing threshold: Pikachu needs to heal when its HP is below 30% of max HP.

## Challenges

*   **Low Encounter Rate:** Difficulty initiating battles to progress towards the primary goal.
*   **Battle Bug:** The primary challenge is the game-breaking battle exit bug, preventing further progress without a work-around.
*   **Pikachu's HP:** Pikachu's current HP level is too low to engage in battles.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Exit Battle Loop:** Continue to attempt to advance the dialog by pressing the "A" button, hoping to exit the glitched battle screen.
2.  **Heal Pikachu:** Immediately after exiting the battle, prioritize healing Pikachu's HP. This may involve using a Potion or returning to a Pokémon Center.  The exact method will depend on available items and location.
3.  **Re-evaluate Strategy:** After healing, re-assess the exploration strategy.  If the bug persists, consider alternative routes or gameplay adjustments (e.g., saving frequently) to mitigate the impact of potential crashes.
4.  **Continue Exploration:**  Once Pikachu is healed and the battle bug is resolved (hopefully), resume exploring Viridian Forest to find and win Pokémon battles.
