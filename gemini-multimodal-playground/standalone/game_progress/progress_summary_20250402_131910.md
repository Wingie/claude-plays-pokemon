# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Successfully defeated a wild Pidgey.
*   Lead Pokémon's health is critically low (9/21 HP).
*   Needs healing urgently.
*   Currently exiting the battle screen to assess location and navigate to the nearest Pokémon Center.

**Recent Actions:**

*   Engaged in multiple turns of battle with a wild Pidgey.
*   Repeatedly used the move "Scratch."
*   Recognized that the Pokémon's HP fell below the 30% healing threshold mid-battle.
*   Prioritized finishing the battle despite low health.
*   Acknowledged the need to heal immediately upon winning the battle.
*   Began the process of exiting the battle screen to locate the Pokémon Center.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Wild Pidgeys are present in the current area.
*   "Scratch" is an effective move against Pidgey (assumed based on battle outcome).
*   Health management is crucial, especially when facing multiple battles.
*   The game AI recognizes and flags the need for healing based on a 30% HP threshold.
*   Location awareness is a prerequisite for efficient navigation to the Pokémon Center.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Exit Battle Screen:** Fully exit the battle screen by pressing "B".
2.  **Assess Location:** Determine current location within the game world.
3.  **Locate Pokémon Center:** Identify the nearest Pokémon Center on the map.
4.  **Navigate to Pokémon Center:** Plan and execute a route to the Pokémon Center.
5.  **Heal Pokémon:** Fully restore Pokémon's health at the Pokémon Center.
6.  **Continue Goal:** Once healed, resume the overarching goal of finding and winning Pokémon battles.

**Insights and Challenges:**

*   The current strategy of spamming "Scratch" seems effective against Pidgey but may not be optimal against other Pokémon.
*   Low health poses a significant risk, making the Pokémon vulnerable to defeat.
*   Navigating the game world efficiently requires familiarity with the map and landmarks.
*   Prioritizing short-term objectives (finishing the battle) over long-term health management can lead to risky situations.
*   Future strategy might involve managing HP proactively with potions during a battle, rather than waiting until it is almost depleted.
