# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** Current

**Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

We are currently navigating the overworld, exploring the area surrounding our starting location. Pidgey is our only Pokémon and is currently at level 6. We are actively seeking wild Pokémon encounters to gain experience and improve our battling skills. We have successfully defeated at least one Rattata.

## Recent Actions (Turns 35-44)

* **Turn 35:** Successfully battled and defeated a wild Rattata, earning 24 EXP for Pidgey.
* **Turns 36-38:** Acknowledged Pidgey's level up to level 6 and the subsequent stat increases. Repeatedly pressed 'A' to advance through the level-up notifications.
* **Turns 39-44:** Focused on exploration within an area characterized by tall grass and trees. Employed a strategy of moving within the tall grass to trigger wild Pokémon encounters. We have moved from an unknown starting position, facing various directions. Current location is approximately (8, 4). We adjusted our movement strategy based on the terrain, aiming to return to tall grass after moving too far into treed areas.

## Key Discoveries

* **Enemy Type:** Confirmed the presence of Rattata in the wild.
* **Leveling:** Successfully leveled up Pidgey to level 6.
* **Terrain Impact:** Recognized that tall grass triggers wild Pokémon encounters. This confirms a basic mechanic of the game.
* **Navigation:** We are able to navigate the overworld and have a basic understanding of how movement works.

## Next Objectives

* **Prioritize Battles:** Continue exploring the tall grass to engage in battles and level up Pidgey.
* **Improve Battle Strategy:** Pay closer attention to battle mechanics and type matchups to optimize Pidgey's performance.
* **Explore the Path:** Investigate the path to the north, while remaining vigilant for wild Pokémon encounters in the tall grass.
* **Document Locations:** Track coordinates more precisely to aid in mapping and backtracking. This becomes more important as the game progresses.
