# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Return to Pallet Town to retrieve the map from Gary's sister.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently unknown, but recently involved in wild Pidgey battles.
*   **Lead Pokémon HP:** Critically low at 9/21 (first battle) and 10/22 (second battle). Healing is urgently required.
*   **Needs Healing:** `True`. A trip to the Pokémon Center is paramount before any other activity.

## Recent Actions

*   Repeatedly engaged in battles with wild Pidgey, using Scratch as the primary attack.
*   Successfully won at least one battle against a Pidgey.
*   Prioritized finishing battles despite low health.
*   Exited battle screens after victories.
*   Determined the need for healing and initiating plans to navigate to a Pokémon Center.

## Key Discoveries

*   Wild Pidgey are a common encounter in the current area.
*   Scratch is a viable, though possibly inefficient, early-game attack.
*   Strategic prioritization is necessary, balancing immediate threats (battles) with long-term needs (healing).
*   The bot calculates a healing threshold of 30% HP.
*   The bot initially got confused and thought it was on the battle screen for turns even after winning the battle.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Location Identification:** Determine the current location. The bot intends to press 'B' to exit any lingering battle screens and assess the surroundings.
2.  **Pokémon Center Navigation:** Identify the route to the nearest Pokémon Center from the current location.
3.  **Heal Pokémon:** Fully restore the lead Pokémon's HP at the Pokémon Center.
4.  **Pallet Town Retrieval:** Once healed, resume travel to Pallet Town.
5.  **Map Acquisition:** Collect the map from Gary's sister in Pallet Town.
