# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** Current Date (Replace with Actual Date)

**Current Goal:** Head north and find the Poké Mart with a blue roof in Viridian City.

## Current Status

*   Engaged in a battle against a Rattata.
*   Charmander is at Level 9 with 18/27 HP.

## Recent Actions (Turns 90-99)

Recent turns have been largely spent struggling to navigate the battle interface. Multiple attempts were made to cancel out of the Pokémon selection/info screens, indicating a possible misunderstanding of the menu options.

*   Repeatedly accessed the Pokémon info/selection screen unintentionally.
*   Spent several turns attempting to select "CANCEL" in various menus within the battle.
*   Finally re-engaged in the battle, recognizing the need to select "FIGHT."

## Key Discoveries & Challenges

*   **User Interface Confusion:** Significant difficulty navigating the battle menu, especially with the "CANCEL" option, leading to wasted turns.
*   **Enemy Encounter:** Battled a Rattata, confirming wild Pokémon encounters are occurring.
*   **Charmander's Status:** Charmander is at level 9 with moderately depleted HP (18/27), indicating the battle has taken some damage.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Win the Current Battle:** Successfully defeat the Rattata using the "FIGHT" command.
2.  **Heal if Necessary:** After the battle, assess Charmander's HP. If significantly low, consider finding a way to heal (e.g., using a Potion or visiting a Pokémon Center).
3.  **Resume Journey to Viridian City:** Once Charmander is healthy and ready, continue heading north towards Viridian City.
4.  **Locate the Blue-Roofed Poké Mart:** Upon reaching Viridian City, the priority is to find the Poké Mart with the distinctive blue roof.

## Strategic Considerations

*   **Menu Familiarization:** The player needs to become more familiar with the menu navigation, particularly the differences between selecting "CANCEL" within different contexts.
*   **Healing:** Develop a strategy for healing Charmander if HP is low, either through items or visiting a Pokémon Center.
*   **Type Advantages:** Consider the type advantages Charmander has and has the opposing pokemon to help ensure victory.
