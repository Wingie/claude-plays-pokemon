# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

## 1. Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, likely still in Viridian Forest (Coordinates: 7, 5)
*   **Objective:** Level up Pokémon
*   **Party Lead:** Pikachu (14/19 HP)
*   **In Battle:** No (`is_in_battle = false`, `current_screen_type = Overworld`)

## 2. Recent Actions & Analysis

Our recent turns have been characterized by two distinct phases: a prolonged battle loop and a return to overworld exploration.

*   **Turns 5-12: Battle Loop Struggle:** We encountered a significant problem in battle. The AI became stuck in a loop consistently trying to use "THUNDERSHOCK" despite potentially not being able to execute the move. The observation logic was not specific enough to correctly identify the state of the battle menu. Attempts to escape (pressing "B") were made to break the loop, but these were initially unsuccessful. The root cause was an incomplete observation: simply "seeing the move selection screen" wasn't enough; confirmation of the presence of menu options ("FIGHT", "BAG", etc.) is needed.

*   **Turns 13-14: Overworld Exploration Resumed:** The AI seems to have recovered from the battle loop and is now correctly navigating the overworld. The current plan involves moving right into the grass to trigger wild Pokémon encounters and thus level up the party.

## 3. Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Observation Criticality:** The battle loop highlighted the importance of precise and complete observations. Simply detecting a "move selection screen" is insufficient. The system needs to verify the presence of expected menu elements to avoid incorrect actions. A solution might include checking for the presence of "FIGHT", "BAG", "POKEMON", "RUN" before attempting move selection.
*   **HP Threshold:** The logic correctly identifies that Pikachu's HP (14/19) is not below the 30% threshold for needing healing (`needs_healing = false`).
*   **Overworld Navigation:** The AI is now capable of moving within the overworld toward grass patches, demonstrating basic navigation skills.

## 4. Next Objectives

*   **Primary:** Level up Pokémon through wild encounters in Viridian Forest. Continue to move right into the grass to trigger battles.
*   **Secondary:** Implement more robust battle observation logic to prevent future battle loops. This includes:
    *   Verifying the presence of core menu options (FIGHT, BAG, POKEMON, RUN) before attempting any battle actions.
    *   Adding logic to detect and handle status conditions (e.g., paralysis, poison) that might prevent actions.
*   **Contingency:** If the battle loop reappears, consider adding a failsafe: if the same action is attempted a certain number of times (e.g., 3), automatically attempt to run.

## 5. Challenges Remaining

*   **Battle Logic Robustness:** The most pressing challenge is improving the AI's ability to accurately interpret the battle screen and respond appropriately. The current looping behavior is unacceptable and hinders progress.
*   **Resource Management:** While currently not an issue, we need to develop strategies for managing items and Pokémon party composition as we progress further into the game.
