# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 25 - 34

**Current Status:**

The party is currently stuck in the Pokémon selection menu. Pidgeon is poisoned, hindering forward progress. We are unable to successfully switch Pidgeon out for Charmander. This is preventing us from achieving our primary objective of finding and winning Pokémon battles.

**Recent Actions:**

*   **Turns 25-34:** Repeated attempts to switch the poisoned Pidgeon with Charmander by selecting Charmander in the Pokemon selection menu and confirming the selection. These actions have been unsuccessful. The cause of this failure is unknown, but further analysis is required to break the loop.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   **Persistent Poisoning:** Pidgeon's poisoning is a significant impediment to progress.
*   **Unresolved Switching Issue:** There appears to be an issue preventing the successful switching of Pokémon within the selection menu. This could be a bug, a misunderstanding of the selection process, or an unreported condition affecting the Pokemon.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Poison Status:** Pidgeon's poisoning is draining its health and limiting our ability to engage in battles.
*   **Stuck in Selection Menu:** The inability to switch Pokémon is preventing us from progressing towards our main objective.
*   **Looping Behavior:** Repeating the same actions without achieving the desired result is a sign of a deeper problem.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Troubleshoot Switching Issue:**
    *   Verify the correct button inputs for switching Pokemon.
    *   Investigate if any status conditions other than poison are preventing the switch.
    *   Consider alternative solutions, such as using an item (if available) to heal Pidgeon or switch to another Pokémon.
2.  **Address Poison Status:**
    *   If switching is not possible, locate and use an antidote to cure Pidgeon's poison. Explore the immediate environment for potential resources.
    *   Potentially faint out, allowing Pidgeon to heal at a Pokemon Center. However, this has the penalty of reducing party funds.
3.  **Resume Battle Objective:** Once the switching issue is resolved and Pidgeon is either healed or replaced, resume the original objective of finding and winning Pokémon battles.

**Strategic Considerations:**

*   We should prioritize finding a way to heal status conditions quickly to avoid getting stuck in similar situations.
*   It may be beneficial to review the game's tutorial or documentation to ensure we are correctly using the Pokémon selection menu.
*   A new tactic may be necessary. We may want to consider fainting Pidgeon so we can return to a Pokemon center to heal.

**Conclusion:**

While progress has stalled due to the combination of Pidgeon's poisoning and an inability to switch Pokémon, addressing the switching issue and then curing the poison is the immediate priority. Once these issues are resolved, we can resume our primary objective of engaging in battles and progressing through the game. Further attention should be given to resource management and understanding in-game mechanics to avoid similar roadblocks in the future.
