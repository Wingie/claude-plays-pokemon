# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** Current Date

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

Currently stuck in a loop within the Pokémon selection menu. Pidgey (Piogeon) is poisoned, preventing progression towards the primary goal of engaging in Pokémon battles. The party is effectively stalled until Pidgey is switched out.

## Recent Actions (Turns 30-39)

The past ten turns have been dedicated to attempting to switch the poisoned Pidgey with Charmander. The strategy has consistently been:

1.  Select Charmander (initially by pressing Down twice, then Down once in Turn 39, suggesting a possible adjustment in the Pokemon selection order).
2.  Confirm the selection (Press A).

Unfortunately, this strategy has repeatedly failed, resulting in a cyclical pattern of identifying the problem (Pidgey is poisoned), formulating the plan (switch to Charmander), and executing the action (Down + A), only to find ourselves back in the same menu on the next turn.

## Key Discoveries & Analysis

*   **Loop Detected:** The repeated attempts to switch Pokémon have revealed a persistent loop, indicating a possible misunderstanding of the game mechanics or a potential glitch.
*   **Poison Impairment:** Pidgey's poisoning is directly hindering progress, reinforcing the importance of addressing status ailments.
*  **Potential Misunderstanding of Pokémon Selection Order:** There was a change in the direction pressed to select Charmander, perhaps indicating confusion around which position the Pokémon occupied in the menu.

## Next Objectives & Contingency Plans

1.  **Break the Loop:** Re-evaluate the approach to switching Pokémon. Consider alternative methods, such as using an item to cure the poison or attempting to flee the area (if applicable, even though not described in provided actions).
2.  **Clarify Menu Navigation:** Double-check the Pokémon selection order within the menu. Experiment with pressing Up instead of Down, or vice-versa, to ensure Charmander is correctly selected.
3. **Explore Alternative Solutions:** Consider if there is an option from the menu other than Pokemon switch that needs to be selected. Examine the available menu options thoroughly.
4.  **Document and Analyze:** Carefully document each action and its outcome to identify patterns and potentially pinpoint the reason for the loop.

Once Pidgey's poison is addressed and a healthy Pokémon is in the lead, the primary objective of finding and winning Pokémon battles will be pursued.
