# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Battling wild Pokémon to level up Pikachu. Pikachu is currently at 16/19 HP.
*   Currently, we are exiting a battle after successfully defeating a Pidgey and gaining 31 EXP.
*   The AI is attempting to trigger another battle.

**Recent Actions & Challenges:**

*   **Initial Battle (Turns 10-16):** Our initial goal was to attack a Pidgey using "THUNDERSHOCK." However, the AI got stuck in a loop. It was consistently entering the "BAG" menu instead of selecting "FIGHT." It recognized its error but couldn't execute the proper sequence of button presses (B to exit Bag, A to select Fight, Right to select Thundershock, A to confirm Thundershock).
*   **Post-Battle (Turns 17-19):** The battle against the Pidgey was successful, resulting in 31 EXP for Pikachu. The AI has recognized that the battle ended and needs to find another one. The AI has correctly planned to press A to advance any dialog and then move in the tall grass to trigger another battle. This logic repeats over the last few turns.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   **Battle Mechanics:** Confirmed the battle menu options (FIGHT, BAG, POKEMON, RUN). Identified "THUNDERSHOCK" as a potentially effective offensive move for Pikachu against Pidgey.
*   **User Interface Errors:** The AI has been struggling to navigate the battle menus, especially transitioning between the "BAG" and "FIGHT" menus. This suggests the need for more robust error handling and improved menu navigation logic.
*   **Overworld Exploration:** Walking in tall grass triggers random encounters, which is the method for leveling up in the current phase.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Successfully Trigger Next Battle:** Ensure consistent execution of exiting dialog (press A) and moving in tall grass (press Up) to trigger another wild Pokémon encounter.
2.  **Improve Menu Navigation:** Address the "stuck in BAG menu" issue. Develop a more reliable method to select "FIGHT" and subsequently the desired move ("THUNDERSHOCK"). This could involve prioritizing the "FIGHT" command upon entering battle.
3.  **Optimize Attack Strategy:** Continue using "THUNDERSHOCK" against Pidgey as the primary leveling strategy.
4.  **Monitor Pikachu's HP:** Ensure Pikachu's health remains above critical levels to avoid fainting. Consider using Potions if necessary (though this would require correctly navigating the "BAG" menu).

**Insights:**

*   The AI's understanding of the game's objective (leveling up) and core mechanics (battling) is sound.
*   The main obstacle is the AI's execution of simple actions due to the complexity of menu navigation and potential misinterpretation of the current game state.
*   The strategy of battling wild Pokémon in tall grass is a viable method for achieving the current goal.
