# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find and engage in battles with wild Pokémon to gain experience and attempt captures.

**Current Status:** Located near tall grass on Route 1, actively searching for wild Pokémon encounters.

## Recent Actions (Turns 20-29):

*   **Initial Location:** Started near the Pokémon Center in Pallet Town (Turns 20).
*   **Challenge:** Repeatedly and accidentally re-entered the Pokémon Center, hindering progress toward Route 1 (Turns 21-24). This indicates a slight difficulty in pathing or accidental button presses.
*   **Solution:** Focused on carefully navigating out of Pallet Town, circumventing obstacles like ledges (Turn 25).
*   **Progress:** Successfully navigated to Route 1 and located an area with tall grass, a prime location for wild Pokémon encounters (Turns 26-29).
*   **Current Activity:** Consistently moving within the tall grass to trigger wild Pokémon battles (Turns 26-29).

## Key Discoveries:

*   **Route 1:** Confirmed as a suitable area for finding wild Pokémon.
*   **Tall Grass:** Identified as the key terrain feature for initiating Pokémon encounters.
*   **Pokémon Center Navigation:** The process of exiting the Pokémon Center has been a recurring challenge, highlighting the need for careful directional input.

## Next Objectives:

1.  **Initiate Wild Pokémon Battles:** Continue exploring the tall grass on Route 1 until an encounter occurs.
2.  **Engage in Battles:** Once a battle is initiated, assess the wild Pokémon's level and type.
3.  **Capture Strategy:** If the wild Pokémon is desirable (e.g., new species, good potential), attempt to weaken and capture it. If not, defeat the Pokémon for experience.
4.  **Resource Management:** Monitor party Pokémon's health and use Potions or return to the Pokémon Center as needed.
5.  **Further Exploration:** After engaging in a few battles on Route 1, explore further north to discover more of the route and potentially new Pokémon.
