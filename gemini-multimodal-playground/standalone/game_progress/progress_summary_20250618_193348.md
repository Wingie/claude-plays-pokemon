# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Current Goal:** Level up Pikachu through wild battles.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently engaged in wild battles, likely near a route with low-level Pokémon.
*   **Pikachu:** HP is at 14/20.
*   **In Battle:** Yes
*   **Opponent:** Currently facing Caterpie.
*   **Move Selection Screen:** Currently active, but experiencing unexpected behavior after the opponent faints.

## Recent Actions

*   Turns 25-28: Repeatedly pressed "A" to advance the initial battle dialog ("Wild CATERPIE appeared!").
*   Turns 29-33: Attempted to select "THUNDERSHOCK" after the battle menu appeared.  Experienced a recurring loop on the move selection screen.
*   Turn 34:  Recognized a bug where the move selection screen remained active even after Caterpie fainted. Planning to advance the dialog to exit the battle.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Targeted Encounter:** Successfully initiated a battle against a Caterpie. Caterpie provide little experience so we need a different opponent.
*   **Repetitive Dialogue:** Multiple turns were spent simply advancing through initial battle dialogue.
*   **Bug Encountered:** Identified a bug causing the move selection screen to remain active after the opponent (Caterpie) faints. This prevents the natural progression out of the battle.
*   **Pikachu Weakened:** Pikachu is below full health (14/20), indicating damage taken in battle.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Looping Gameplay:** Several turns were spent stuck on the move selection screen, requiring manual intervention and recognition of a bug.
*   **Low HP:** Pikachu's current health (14/20) poses a risk if consecutive battles are engaged.
*   **Opponent Difficulty:** Caterpie are too easy and thus provide little experience for leveling.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Exit the Battle:** Press "A" to advance the dialogue and hopefully exit the bugged battle state.
2.  **Heal Pikachu:** Immediately head to the nearest Pokémon Center to restore Pikachu's HP.
3.  **Find Higher Level Pokemon:** Locate a better area to level up Pikachu. Caterpie are too weak, and leveling will take too long.
