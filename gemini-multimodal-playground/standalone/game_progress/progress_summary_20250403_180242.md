# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen - Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest, Coordinates (4, 7)
*   **Party:**
    *   Pidgey (Level 12, 31/33 HP)
*   **Progress:** Stuck in a repetitive battle loop.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 35-44:** Engaged in a series of battles, all against Caterpie.
*   **Battle Strategy:** Consistently using Tackle with Pidgey.
*   **Outcome:** Battles are ongoing, with no clear victory or loss reported in the logs. Pidgey's HP remains consistent.

## Key Discoveries

*   **High Caterpie Encounter Rate:** The current location (4, 7) seems to have a very high encounter rate for Caterpie. This is preventing exploration.
*   **Tackle Effectiveness:** Tackle seems to be doing *some* damage to Caterpie, but not enough to quickly end the battles. The battles continue for a sustained amount of time.
*   **Location Stuck:** The coordinates are static, implying that the character is not moving between battles.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Repetitive Encounters:** The continuous Caterpie battles are hindering progress towards the main goal of finding Pikachu.
*   **Ineffective Battle Strategy?** While Tackle is a logical move, it's not resolving battles quickly. Perhaps a different move or strategy is needed.
*   **Exploration Blocked:** Unable to move forward and explore due to constant battles.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Break the Caterpie Loop:** Evaluate if a different battle strategy is necessary. Consider the following:
    *   **Different Move:** Does Pidgey have any other moves that might be more effective against Caterpie? Perhaps a move that targets Bug-types specifically? Check Pidgey's move set.
    *   **Potion Use:** If available, consider using a potion to restore HP between battles, prolonging exploration time.
    *   **Run Away:** Is running away from battle a viable option? If so, implement a strategy to attempt to flee from some encounters to allow for movement.

2.  **Resume Exploration:** Once the Caterpie encounter issue is addressed, resume exploring Viridian Forest, prioritizing areas that might have a higher chance of Pikachu spawns (if such information is known or can be inferred).

3.  **Pikachu Capture Strategy:** Once a Pikachu is encountered, prepare a capture strategy (e.g., weakening the Pikachu, using Poké Balls).
