# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 27, 2023 (Based on "recent" game turns)
**Current Goal:** Level up Pikachu

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Stuck in a battle loop (likely a bug).
*   **Party Status:**
    *   Pikachu: HP 14/20. Needs healing.
*   **Current Activity:** Battling a fainted Caterpie. The game is erroneously displaying the move selection screen after the opponent Pokémon has fainted.

## Recent Actions (Turns 80-89)

*   Repeatedly attempted to exit the battle loop by pressing 'A'.
*   Observed that the game remains stuck on the move selection screen after defeating a wild Caterpie, despite numerous attempts to advance the dialog.

## Key Discoveries and Challenges

*   **Encountered a Game-Breaking Bug:** The primary challenge is a persistent bug that prevents exiting a battle after defeating a Wild Caterpie. This bug halts progress completely.
*   **Pikachu's Health:** Pikachu's health is low, making it imperative to heal as soon as possible once the battle can be exited.
*   **Limited Options:** While battling to level up Pikachu was the initial goal, the bug prevents any further battles or progress towards that goal.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Escape the Battle Loop:** The IMMEDIATE priority is to find a way to circumvent or resolve the battle loop bug. If repeatedly pressing 'A' doesn't work, consider alternative actions such as:
    *   Trying a different button press (e.g., B to attempt to flee, Start button).
    *   Resetting the emulator (as a last resort). *NOTE: This will likely lose progress and should only be done if no other solution can be found.*

2.  **Heal Pikachu:** Once the battle loop is resolved, immediately heal Pikachu at the nearest Pokémon Center.

3.  **Resume Leveling:** After healing, return to the intended goal of finding suitable battles to level up Pikachu.
    *   Consider areas with weaker Pokémon to minimize risk while Pikachu is at a lower level.

## Strategy Notes

*   **Battle Loop Bug Mitigation:**
    *   Consider if the emulator has save states. If so, saving *before* entering a battle can provide a fallback in case of encountering this bug again.
*   **Future Battle Strategy:**
    *   Continue to prioritize Thunder Shock to efficiently defeat Flying and Water type Pokémon.
    *   Be mindful of Pikachu's low HP and prioritize healing as needed.

## Concerns

*   The game-breaking bug severely hinders progression. If the bug persists and cannot be resolved, further progress will be impossible without starting a new game or finding an alternate ROM/emulator.
