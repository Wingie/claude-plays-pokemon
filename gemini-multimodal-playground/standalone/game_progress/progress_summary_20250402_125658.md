# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 15-24

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

We are currently engaged in a prolonged series of battles with wild Pidgey. While consistently engaging in battles, the outcome and overall progress towards the primary goal (finding and winning battles) is unclear. The report suggests repetitive battles with the same Pokémon.

## Recent Actions

Over the past ten turns, the primary action has been:

*   Repeatedly attacking wild Pidgey in battle.
*   Consistently selecting the "attack" option in battle.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Overabundance of Pidgey:** The area currently being explored appears to have a high concentration of wild Pidgey.
*   **Lack of Strategic Variety:** Only the attack option is being utilized, suggesting a possible oversight on strategic game play such as running or catching a Pokémon.
*   **Inability to Conquer the battles:** There has been no indication of winning or losing battles.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Monotony:** Repeatedly battling the same Pokémon without a clear outcome could lead to stagnation and lack of progression.
*   **Strategic Limitations:** Relying solely on attacking may not be the most efficient or effective way to win battles or progress in the game.
*   **Unclear Battle Outcomes:** No indication of success of failure is mentioned.

## Next Objectives

To optimize progress and break the current stalemate, the following steps are recommended:

1.  **Confirm Battle Outcomes:** We need to determine the result of these battles (win, lose, or draw). If we're losing repeatedly, we need to re-evaluate our strategy.
2.  **Vary Battle Tactics:** Explore different battle options beyond simply attacking. This includes:
    *   **Using different Pokémon (if available).**
    *   **Employing different moves.**
    *   **Considering the "Run" option to escape battles and explore new areas.**
    *   **Attempting to catch Pidgey for strategic advantage**
3.  **Explore New Areas:** If possible, move to a different location to encounter a wider variety of Pokémon and potentially more rewarding battles.
4.  **Evaluate Team Composition:** Review the current Pokémon team (if any) and identify any weaknesses or opportunities for improvement.
5.  **Reassess Goal Priorities:** If we are only finding Pidgeys, we need to reassess locations to achieve a more diverse pokemon battle.
