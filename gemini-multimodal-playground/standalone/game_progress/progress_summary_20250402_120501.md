**Current Goal:** find battles to grow the mankey

# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find and engage in battles to train the Mankey (though Charmander is currently selected).

**Current Status:**  Character is currently near tall grass on Route 1 after repeated accidental re-entry into the Pokémon Center. A Pokémon selection menu is currently open, with Charmander selected.

## Recent Actions (Turns 22-31)

*   **Repeated Pokémon Center Entry/Exit (Turns 22-25):**  Multiple turns were spent accidentally re-entering the Pokémon Center. This was a significant obstacle to the primary goal of finding battles. Navigation was initially hampered by an obstacle (ledge).
*   **Route 1 Exploration (Turns 25-29):** After exiting the Pokémon Center, the character navigated towards the tall grass on Route 1, repeatedly moving upward in an attempt to trigger an encounter.
*   **Menu Navigation (Turns 30-31):** Encountered a menu with an "EXIT" option and subsequently a menu prompting Pokémon selection, where Charmander is currently selected.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Tall Grass = Wild Pokémon (Confirmed):** The area of tall grass on Route 1 is the primary location for finding wild Pokémon battles.
*   **Accidental Re-entry:**  The Pokémon Center door is easily triggered, requiring careful navigation.
*   **Pokémon Selection Menu:** The selection of Pokémon is required before the wild Pokémon battle.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Navigation Issues:**  The initial navigation was poor, leading to repeated unintended entries into the Pokémon Center, wasting multiple turns.
*   **Menu Navigation Confusion:** Unclear the exact purpose or reason for the "EXIT" menu (Turn 30)

## Next Objectives

1.  **Confirm Charmander Selection:** Press A again to confirm Charmander as the active Pokémon for battle.
2.  **Re-engage with Tall Grass:** After selecting Charmander, return to the tall grass on Route 1 and continue moving around to trigger a wild Pokémon encounter.
3.  **Initiate Battle:** Once a wild Pokémon encounter is triggered, initiate battle.
4.  **Train Mankey (Eventual Goal):** After the battle, switch out Charmander for Mankey to get experience for the intended Pokémon. If Mankey is not yet in the party, it must be caught first.

## Strategic Insights

*   **Precision Movement:**  Careful, deliberate movement is crucial to avoid accidentally re-entering buildings and other unintended interactions.
*   **Tall Grass Focus:** Prioritize exploration of tall grass areas to maximize the chance of encountering wild Pokémon.
*   **Pokémon Selection:**  The selected Pokémon will be used in battles. Ensure that the selected Pokémon is capable of battle.
