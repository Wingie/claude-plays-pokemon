# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Expedition

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Deep within Viridian Forest. Current coordinates are unknown but we are confirmed to be in tall grass.
*   **Lead Pokémon:** Pidgey
    *   **HP:** 26/29
    *   **Status:** Healthy (no status conditions)
*   **Battle Status:** Currently engaged in a battle with a Caterpie.
*   **Resources:**
    *   **Poké Balls:** Unknown count.
    *   **Needs Healing:** No (HP is acceptable, though further damage should be monitored).

## Recent Actions (Turns 0-9)

The primary activity has been exploring the tall grass in Viridian Forest in an attempt to find a Pikachu. This has involved the following steps:

1.  **Initial Positioning:**  Moved from coordinate (6, 11) into the tall grass.
2.  **Wild Pokémon Encounters:** Several encounters with Weedle and Caterpie.
3.  **Battle Strategy:** Repeatedly chose the "Fight" option, defaulting to the first offensive move.
4.  **Continued Battles:** We are currently engaged in an ongoing battle against a Caterpie.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Viridian Forest Encounters:** Weedle and Caterpie are confirmed as common encounters in Viridian Forest.
*   **Pidgey's Health:** Pidgey's HP has been reduced slightly during battles (from 29/29 to 26/29).
*   **Battle Procedure:** Repeatedly engaging in battles, indicating the need for refined battle strategy.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Lack of Pikachu:** The primary objective of finding a Pikachu has not been achieved yet.
*   **Repetitive Encounters:** The encounters have been limited to Weedle and Caterpie, leading to some monotony.
*   **Default Battle Approach:** Currently using the default first move selection in battles, which may not be optimal.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Exploring Viridian Forest:** Persist in searching the tall grass for a Pikachu. Prioritize areas not yet explored.
2.  **Refine Battle Strategy:**  Consider learning which offensive move is most efficient for Pidgey and tailor the approach based on the opponent.
3.  **Monitor Pidgey's HP:** Keep a close watch on Pidgey's HP and be prepared to retreat to Viridian City PC to heal if necessary. The threshold for healing will be 20 HP.
4. **Catch Encountered Pokemon:** Start attempting to catch the encountered Pokemon if enough Pokeballs exist, otherwise, continue to faint them.

## Future Considerations

*   **Poké Ball Management:** Need to determine and track the number of Poké Balls available. This will impact the decision to engage and capture Pokémon.
*   **Move Set Analysis:** Once a Pokémon Center is accessible, research the available moves for Pidgey and select the most effective ones.
*   **Alternative Locations:** If Pikachu remains elusive, consider alternative locations within Viridian Forest or reconsider the objective altogether.
