# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Level up our Pokémon.

**Current Status:**

*   Engaged in battle with a wild Pidgey. Pikachu's HP is currently 16/19.
*   Battle menu is visible, giving us the options to "FIGHT", "BAG", "POKEMON", and "RUN".
*   Available moves for Pikachu are "GROWL" and "THUNDERSHOCK".

**Recent Actions:**

*   Initially, the system was repeatedly pressing 'A' to advance through the dialog at the start of the battle to access the battle menu (Turns 0-7).
*   Once the battle menu was accessible, the system was set to consistently select "THUNDERSHOCK" to attack the Pidgey.

**Key Discoveries & Insights:**

*   **Encounter Rate:** Wild Pidgeys are a common encounter in the current location.
*   **Battle Automation:** The system successfully identified the battle menu and available move options, enabling the consistent selection of "THUNDERSHOCK".
*   **Move Selection Strategy:** Prioritizing "THUNDERSHOCK" over "GROWL" for faster battles.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   The initial turns were spent progressing through the battle dialogue to access the battle menu, hindering immediate action.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Execute "THUNDERSHOCK":** Continue selecting "THUNDERSHOCK" in subsequent turns to defeat the Pidgey and gain experience points.
2.  **Monitor HP:** Track Pikachu's HP and strategize healing (using items from the "BAG") if it gets too low to avoid fainting.
3.  **Identify Level Up:** Confirm a level up and note any stat increases or new move acquisitions.
4.  **Continue Grinding:** Persist in battling wild Pokémon (likely Pidgeys) to accumulate experience and level up the team.
5.  **Explore Alternative Locations:** If Pidgeys become too easy or the experience yield is low, investigate new areas with potentially stronger Pokémon.
