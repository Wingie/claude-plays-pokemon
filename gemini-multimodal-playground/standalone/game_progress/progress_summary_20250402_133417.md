# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Lead Pokémon: Pidgey (Level 8, 11/25 HP)
*   Location: Unknown (Navigating based on current position)
*   Objective: Find and catch a Pikachu; Level up Pokémon.
*   Urgent Needs: Pidgey requires healing. `needs_healing = True`

**Recent Actions (Turns 25-34):**

The primary focus of the last ten turns has been battling a wild Rattata.  We encountered it while exploring, interrupting our Pikachu search. The battle was fairly straightforward, with Pidgey primarily using Tackle to inflict damage. Although Pidgey ultimately won, it sustained significant damage, dropping its HP to a critical level.

*   **Turn 25-33:** Engaged in a battle with a Level 3 Rattata. Repeatedly used Tackle.
*   **Turn 33:** Rattata fainted, battle won, but Pidgey's HP is critically low (11/25).
*   **Turn 34:** Exiting battle screen. Immediately need to find a Pokémon Center to heal Pidgey.

**Key Discoveries & Insights:**

*   **Pidgey's Moveset:** Pidgey knows Tackle and Sand-Attack. Tackle is preferred for offensive purposes.
*   **Battle Strategy:** Tackle is effective against low-level Pokémon like Rattata. However, sustained battles can leave Pidgey vulnerable.
*   **Healing Priority:**  We learned that `needs_healing` becomes critical when Pidgey's HP drops below 30% of its maximum.
*   **Location Awareness:** Our primary obstacle is our lack of spatial awareness. We need to identify our current location and the nearest Pokémon Center.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Low HP:** Pidgey's low HP is a major concern.  Further battles without healing could lead to a game over.
*   **Limited Information:** Lack of knowledge regarding the surrounding area makes it difficult to locate a Pokémon Center.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Immediate Healing:** Prioritize finding and reaching a Pokémon Center to heal Pidgey. We'll be moving forward cautiously.
2.  **Location Identification:** Attempt to identify our current location. Look for landmarks or signs.
3.  **Pikachu Search:** Once Pidgey is healed, resume the search for Pikachu, focusing on areas with tall grass where Pikachu are more likely to appear.
4.  **Optimize Battle Strategy:** Evaluate the effectiveness of Tackle and potentially consider using Sand-Attack in specific situations (e.g., against higher-level opponents). However, prioritize finishing the current battle as quickly as possible.
