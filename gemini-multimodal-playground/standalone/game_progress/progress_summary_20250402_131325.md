# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

*   **Pokémon:** MAN
*   **MAN's HP:** 18/21 (Above 30% threshold, no need to heal)
*   **Location:** Currently in the overworld, standing in tall grass.
*   **Overall:** Proceeding with the primary goal of battling Pokémon.

## Recent Actions (Turns 55-64)

*   **Turn 55:** Won a battle against a wild Rattata.
*   **Turns 56-62:** Focused on locating tall grass to initiate battles, moving primarily to the right. Experiencing difficulty maintaining position within the tall grass.
*   **Turns 63-64:** Successfully located tall grass again. Initiating movement within tall grass to trigger battles.

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Battle Reward:** Winning battles yields 24 EXP for MAN.
*   **Location Awareness:** The game is providing coordinate information (e.g., (6,11)), suggesting possible use for future navigation.
*   **Strategic Challenges:** Maintaining a position within the tall grass appears to be a challenge, possibly due to movement patterns or game mechanics.
*   **Health Management:** MAN's HP is consistently above the 30% threshold, eliminating the immediate need for healing.
*   **Repetitive Actions:** The gameplay loop currently consists of finding tall grass, moving within it, battling, and then re-finding tall grass.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Trigger Encounters:** Continue moving randomly (or strategically) within the tall grass to trigger more Pokémon battles.
2.  **Monitor MAN's HP:** Keep a close eye on MAN's HP and prepare to seek out a Pokémon Center if necessary.
3.  **Optimize Movement:** Investigate more effective movement patterns within the tall grass to maximize encounter rate and minimize accidental exits. Potentially start mapping locations to optimize travel to tall grass.
4. **Explore the World:** While battling is the current focus, consider taking the opportunity to explore surrounding areas, particularly when not actively in tall grass.
