# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 85-94

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles

## Current Status

HAN, our Pokémon, is at full health (19/19 HP) and is actively participating in battles. We are currently engaging in battles with wild Pokémon, specifically Pidgey, in the game world. A battle was aborted safely (Turn 94).

## Recent Actions

*   **Healing:** HAN was successfully healed to full health (19/19 HP) using a Potion (Turns 85-88). We navigated the Items menu and selected HAN as the target for the Potion.
*   **Battling:** We engaged in multiple battles with Pidgey, consistently using the first attack option (Turns 89-90, 92).
*   **Item Menu Navigation:** There were multiple instances of entering and exiting the Items menu, seemingly unintentionally (Turns 91, 93). This suggests a possible user error or confusion regarding menu navigation.
*   **Escaping a Battle:** A battle was successfully escaped (Turn 94).

## Key Discoveries

*   **Effectiveness of Potions:** Potions are effective in restoring HAN's HP to full.
*   **Pidgey Encounters:** Wild Pidgey are frequently encountered in our current location.
*   **Escape Option:** The game allows for escaping wild Pokémon battles.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Battling:** Resume searching for and engaging in Pokémon battles, focusing on winning battles against wild Pokémon. The original goal to find and win battles remains the priority.
2.  **Refine Menu Navigation:** Minimize unnecessary visits to the Items menu. Possibly review controller mappings or tutorial materials to better understand menu operation to improve overall efficiency.
3.  **Evaluate First Attack Option:** Observe the effectiveness of the first attack option against different Pokémon. Consider exploring different attack strategies based on Pokémon type matchups and move effectiveness.
4. **Consider catching a new Pokemon**: Though battling is a priority, it is worth while to try to catch new pokemon to expand our team.
