# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on prompt submission)
**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, within tall grass (location specific is unknown).
*   **Lead Pokémon HP:** 15/21 (Above 30% threshold).
*   **Status:** Actively seeking Pokémon battles in the tall grass.
*   **Engaged in Battle:** Yes (Turn 84)

## Recent Actions (Turns 75-84)

*   **Turn 75-76:** Defeated a wild Pidgey, gained experience points.  Returned to the overworld after advancing dialogue.
*   **Turn 77-83:** Repeatedly moved randomly within tall grass, attempting to trigger a Pokémon battle. No battles were initiated during this period, although progress was made toward exploration. HP remained above the healing threshold.
*   **Turn 84:** Encountered a Pokémon and initiated a battle. Now focusing on winning this encounter.

## Key Discoveries & Observations

*   **Wild Pokémon Encounter Rate:** Encounter rate in the tall grass appears relatively low, requiring multiple movements to trigger a battle.
*   **HP Management:** Current HP level allows for continued exploration without immediate need for healing. Focus will be on winning the battle at hand.
*   **Dialogue Handling:** Successfully navigating post-battle dialogue.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Win Current Battle (Turn 84 onward):** Successfully defeat the wild Pokémon encountered in the current battle. The immediate focus is on executing the first move.
2.  **Continue Seeking Battles:** Upon exiting the current battle, continue exploring the tall grass to find and win more Pokémon battles.
3.  **Monitor HP:** Maintain awareness of lead Pokémon's HP and prioritize healing if it falls below 30% to prevent fainting and backtracking.
