# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

**Current Status:**

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest, exploring tall grass.
*   **Lead Pokémon:** Pidgey
    *   HP: 26/29
    *   Status: Healthy (Needs Healing: False)
*   **Progression:**  Entering and exiting battles with common Pokémon.
*   **Poké Ball Count:** Unknown (Critical to determine, as catching Pikachu is the main objective)
*   **Coordinates:** Unknown. Need to track movement for better pathing.

**Recent Actions (Turns 4-13):**

*   **Turns 4-9:** Repeatedly encountered and battled Caterpie. Pidgey took some damage (HP dropped from 29 to 26).  The strategy was always to use the "Fight" option and select the first move, implying a lack of move knowledge or strategic selection.
*   **Turns 10-13:** Completed a series of battles (likely against Pidgey, as indicated by EXP gain). After each victory, a plan was generated to move three steps within the tall grass, alternating between Up and Right directions. This likely isn't a directed path towards a particular location.

**Key Discoveries & Observations:**

*   **Common Encounters:** Caterpie and Pidgey are prevalent in Viridian Forest.
*   **Battle Strategy:** Currently relying on basic "Fight" commands and default moves. Requires better move selection for more efficient battles and catching stronger Pokémon.
*   **Resource Management:** Pidgey has taken minor damage. While healing isn't immediately required, tracking HP and planning for PokéCenter visits will be crucial to avoid fainting.
*   **Location Awareness:** The agent is unable to track movement within the forest, and therefore unlikely to navigate to a specific location without significant improvement in tracking and planning capabilities.

**Challenges:**

*   **Lack of Spatial Awareness:**  Not tracking coordinates makes targeted exploration difficult. This severely hinders finding specific Pokémon like Pikachu.
*   **Basic Battle Strategy:** The reliance on the first move is inefficient. Move selection must be improved for faster battles and increased chances of catching wild Pokémon.
*   **Resource Tracking:** Need to track the number of Poké Balls available. Running out of Poké Balls before finding Pikachu would be a major setback.
*   **Repeated Battles:** Repeatedly encountering Caterpie and Pidgey while searching for Pikachu.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Implement Coordinate Tracking:**  Prioritize implementing a system to track `current_coords` and `previous_coords` based on movement actions.
2.  **Acquire More Poké Balls:** If the Poké Ball count is low, visit the Poké Mart in Viridian City before continuing the search.
3.  **Improve Battle Strategy:**
    *   Identify Pidgey's moveset and their effectiveness against different types of Pokémon.
    *   Learn when to use different moves to weaken Pokémon for capture.
4.  **Refine Movement Strategy:** Replace the random walk with a more directed search pattern. Consider systematically exploring the forest.
5.  **Continue Searching for Pikachu:**  Maintain the primary goal of finding and catching a Pikachu.  Be prepared to use Poké Balls effectively.
