# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on the prompt request)
**Game:** Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Unknown, but engaged in a battle.
*   **Party Leader:** Charmander (Level 9, 18/27 HP)
*   **Opponent:** Rattata
*   **Goal:** Heading north to find the blue-roofed Poké Mart in Viridian City (long-term). Currently focused on winning the ongoing battle.

## Recent Actions

The last ten turns have been focused primarily on navigating menus within a battle against a Rattata. Specifically, the player encountered significant difficulties:

*   **Accidental Navigation:** Several turns were spent unintentionally accessing the Pokémon info screen (SUMMARY/CANCEL).
*   **Cancelation Confusion:** The player struggled to select "CANCEL" to return to the battle screen from various menus, including the Pokémon selection screen. There was repeated and ineffective attempts to cancel or exit screens.
*   **Fight Selection:** Eventually, the player correctly identified the need to select "FIGHT" to attack the Rattata.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Menu Navigation is Tricky:** The game's menu system can be confusing, particularly during battle. Navigating back to the fight can be difficult.
*   **Charmander's Vulnerability:** Charmander is currently at low health (18/27 HP) and could faint during this battle.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Win the Battle:** Execute "FIGHT" and defeat the Rattata.
2.  **Heal Charmander (if necessary):** If Charmander's health is low after the battle, find a way to heal it (either using a potion or visiting a Pokémon Center).
3.  **Continue North towards Viridian City:** Once Charmander is healthy, resume the journey north to find the Poké Mart with the blue roof.
4.  **Improve Menu Familiarity:** Practice navigating menus outside of battle to reduce confusion and wasted turns.
