# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Exploring Route 1 (inferred based on wild Pokémon encountered).
*   Engaged in battles to gain experience and learn combat mechanics.
*   Pidgey is being used in battles and gaining experience.
*   Understanding the basic battle flow (selecting FIGHT and a move).

**Recent Actions (Turns 50-59):**

*   **Turn 50:** Initial exploration blocked by trees at (10,6). Attempting to move right.
*   **Turns 52-53:** Navigated a Pokémon selection menu and chose Charmander (but this was incorrect, Pidgey was used later on).
*   **Turns 54-59:** Engaged in multiple battles with a wild Rattata.
    *   Repeatedly used the 'Tackle' move with Pidgey.
    *   Gained 24 EXP for Pidgey after a battle.

**Key Discoveries & Insights:**

*   **Terrain Navigation:** Initial movement blocked by terrain features (trees).  Requires exploration to find accessible paths.
*   **Battle Mechanics:** The basic battle sequence involves selecting "FIGHT" and then choosing a move. The "A" button appears to be the primary input for selection and continuation.
*   **Pokémon Selection Confusion:** There appears to be some confusion regarding which Pokémon to select and use in battle. The initial choice of Charmander was later corrected to Pidgey.
*   **Wild Pokémon Encounters:** Rattata are a common wild Pokémon in the current area.
*   **Experience Points:** Pokémon gain experience points after battles, contributing to level progression.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Terrain Obstacles:** Initial movement was blocked, requiring alternative exploration strategies.
*   **Pokémon Selection:** There's been some confusion about which Pokémon is the appropriate choice for battle.
*   **Move Selection:** Limited information about the effectiveness of different moves.  Currently relying on the first move ('Tackle').

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Continue exploring Route 1:**  Find more battles to gain experience and level up Pidgey.
2.  **Improve Pokémon selection strategy:** Ensure the correct Pokémon is selected for battles.
3.  **Learn about different move types:** Start experimenting with different moves (if available) to understand their effects and effectiveness.
4.  **Navigate terrain:** Continue exploring the surrounding area, overcoming terrain obstacles to discover new areas and encounters.
