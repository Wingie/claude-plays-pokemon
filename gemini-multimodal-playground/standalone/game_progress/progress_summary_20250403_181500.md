# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up our Pokémon.

## Current Status

*   Currently located in an area with tall grass, coordinates (7, 5). Location name is unknown.
*   Lead Pokémon has 19/19 HP and does not need healing.
*   Encountering frequent wild Rattata battles.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 0-7, 3-6:** Repeatedly engaged in battles with wild Rattata. Due to lack of information about available moves, "A" (first move) was repeatedly selected.
*   **Turns 23-24:** Recognized that location coordinates were not updating properly, causing repeated actions. Shifted focus to simply moving to the right within the tall grass in hopes of triggering battles to level up.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Rattata are common:** The most frequent wild Pokémon encountered so far has been Rattata.
*   **Need move information:** The strategy of blindly selecting the first move is not optimal. We need to identify the types and effects of our Pokémon's moves.
*   **Location Tracking Issues:** There seems to be an underlying issue with location coordinate updates, which needs to be resolved to accurately assess progress.

## Challenges

*   **Repetitive Encounters:**  Constantly battling the same Pokémon without any apparent progress.
*   **Lack of Move Information:** Inability to make informed decisions during battles due to unknown moves.
*   **Coordinate Update Problem:** Stagnant coordinates make it difficult to explore the environment or trigger encounters effectively.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Identify Pokémon Moves:** Find a way to determine our Pokémon's current moves, including their types and effects. This might involve accessing the Pokémon's summary screen in the game.
2.  **Address Coordinate Issue:** Troubleshoot the cause of the stagnant location coordinates. This is crucial for progressing through the game world. We need to ensure movement is registered correctly.
3.  **Strategic Move Selection:** Once move information is available, prioritize selecting moves that are super effective against Normal-type Pokémon like Rattata.
4.  **Explore Beyond Initial Area:** Once the coordinate issue is resolved, explore surrounding areas to discover new Pokémon and potential training spots.

## Notes

The initial strategy of blindly selecting the first move in battle is ineffective and time-consuming. Prioritizing knowledge gathering (move sets) and resolving the location tracking issue are critical next steps.
