# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Exploring the initial grassy area with the primary objective of catching Pokémon.
*   Charmander (level unspecified) is currently fainted. The journey has encountered a small obstacle due to lack of healing items.

**Recent Actions:**

*   **Exploration:** Wandered through the initial grassy area.
*   **Encounter:** Engaged in a battle with a wild Pidgey.
*   **Combat Attempts:** Used "Fight," "Scratch," "Ember," and "Growl" against the Pidgey. Ember was noted as being "super effective."
*   **Capture Attempts:** Attempted to use a Poké Ball (selection method noted as "right to select 'RUN' then 'B' to select 'POKEBALL'")
*   **Healing Attempt:** Intended to use a Potion, but discovered that none are currently in the inventory.
*   **Faint:** Charmander fainted during the battle with Pidgey.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Wild Pidgey can be found in the grassy area.
*   Ember is a super effective move against Pidgey.
*   Charmander's HP is relatively low, leading to a quick defeat without potions.
*   Currently lacking potions or other healing items.
*   Strategy to lower Pidgey's attack with Growl was deemed insufficient for survivability.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Heal Charmander:** The immediate priority is to heal Charmander. This likely requires returning to the Pokémon Center.
2.  **Acquire Healing Items:** Purchase Potions or other healing items at the Poké Mart to prevent future faints.
3.  **Re-attempt Capture:** Once Charmander is healed and equipped with healing items, return to the grassy area and attempt to catch a Pidgey (or other available Pokémon).
4.  **Consider Leveling:** Before venturing too far, consider battling more wild Pokémon to level up Charmander and increase its HP and other stats.
