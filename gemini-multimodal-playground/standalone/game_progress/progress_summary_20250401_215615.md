# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on Prompt Submission)

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Presumably still en route to Viridian City, potentially engaging in a trainer battle or wild encounter.
*   **Party:**  Currently using Charmander. Charmander has taken some damage, currently at 18/27 HP.
*   **Goal:** Head north and find the Poké Mart with the blue roof in Viridian City.

## Recent Actions

*   Engaged in a battle against a Rattata (likely wild encounter).
*   Repeatedly selected Charmander from the Pokémon selection menu, then exited the Pokémon info screen. The logic loop suggests difficulty navigating the battle menus.
*   Successfully selected the "FIGHT" option in the battle.

## Key Discoveries & Challenges

*   **Menu Navigation Difficulties:** The player is struggling to navigate the battle menus efficiently, getting stuck in loops between Pokémon selection and stat screens. This is resulting in wasted turns and potential delays.
*   **Rattata Encounter:** Encountered and battling a Rattata. This confirms the player is likely on a route with common early-game Pokémon.
*   **Charmander Health:** Charmander has taken some damage (18/27 HP), suggesting that battles are happening and are causing a drain on resources.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Complete the current battle:** Focus on defeating the Rattata.
2.  **Improve Menu Navigation:** Prioritize learning the battle menu structure to avoid unnecessary loops and wasted actions. Consider looking up a battle menu guide if needed.
3.  **Continue Journey North:** Proceed towards Viridian City, keeping Charmander's health in mind.
4.  **Reach Viridian City and Locate the Poké Mart:** Once in the city, find the Poké Mart with the blue roof to potentially restock items, heal Charmander, and progress the story.
