# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 90-99

**Current Goal:** Level up Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   Pikachu's health is critically low (11/20).
*   Unable to engage in battles due to low health.
*   Continuously encountering wild Pokémon, leading to repeated attempts to flee.

## Recent Actions

*   **Repeatedly attempted to run from battles (Turns 90-99).** Each turn involved the following actions:
    1.  Encountering a wild Pokémon.
    2.  Identifying Pikachu's low health.
    3.  Selecting the "RUN" option in the battle menu (Down, Down, A).
*   *Outcome*: The report unfortunately does not indicate if running was succesful

## Key Discoveries

*   **Pikachu is in no shape for battles until healed.** This is the main blocking point and takes precedence over the goal.
*   The game is generating frequent wild Pokémon encounters.
*   The consistent nature of the battle menu and available actions has been confirmed.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Immediate Priority: Heal Pikachu.** The primary focus must shift to healing Pikachu to full health. This likely involves returning to a Pokémon Center. We must change location.
2.  **Determine Location Strategy:** Before proceeding further, decide on the best location to travel to and heal Pikachu. This might involve identifying the nearest Pokémon Center and planning a safe route to avoid further encounters.
3.  **Execute Travel and Healing:** Implement the selected travel route, minimizing wild Pokémon encounters as much as possible. Once at a Pokémon Center, heal Pikachu.
4.  **Re-evaluate Leveling Strategy:** Once Pikachu is healed, assess the current level and suitable training areas. Consider easier opponents to start, avoiding situations where Pikachu is constantly at risk.
