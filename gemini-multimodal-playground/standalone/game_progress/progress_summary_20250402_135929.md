# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Assumed based on prompt submission)

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest (exploring the tall grass)
*   **Lead Pokémon Health:** 26/29 HP
*   **Battle Status:** Not currently in battle, but actively seeking encounters.
*   **Progress:** Initial exploration underway. A few battles have occurred, but no Pikachu encountered yet.
*   **Inventory:** Pokeball Count: Unknown

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 0-2:** Initially entered Viridian Forest and began moving randomly in the tall grass to trigger battles.  Movement sequence: Right, Up, Right.
*   **Turns 5-9:** Engaged in multiple battles with a Metapod. The strategy was consistently to select "Fight" and use the first available move. The battle lasted several turns.
*   **Turns 12-13:** Exited a battle (likely with Pidgey) and planned further random movement. Received 30 EXP. Movement sequence: Up, Right, Up.

## Key Discoveries & Observations

*   **Encounter Rate:** Encounters in Viridian Forest are frequent.
*   **Enemy Types:** Encountered Metapod and Pidgey. Pikachu is not yet confirmed to be nearby.
*   **Battle Strategy:** The basic "Fight" -> First Move strategy is functional but lacks nuance.
*   **State Tracking:** State tracking of health and coordinates is currently unreliable, as coordinates are always unknown.
*   **Battle Summary Handling:** The system correctly identifies when a battle ends based on EXP gain, but a more reliable "is_clearing_battle_summary" flag is needed.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Finding Pikachu:** The primary objective is proving elusive. Requires continued exploration.
*   **Repetitive Battles:** Encountering the same Pokémon (Metapod) repeatedly. Need to explore different areas within Viridian Forest to diversify encounters.
*   **Lack of Move Selection:** The current battle strategy is rudimentary.  Implementing move selection is crucial for more efficient battles.
*   **Unknown Pokeball Count:** Cannot catch a Pikachu without knowing the number of available Pokeballs. This needs to be tracked.
*   **Coordinate Tracking:** The current coordinate system is not functioning and always reports "Unknown." This makes targeted exploration impossible.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continued Exploration:** Continue moving randomly in the tall grass of Viridian Forest, prioritizing areas not yet explored.
2.  **Pikachu Prioritization:** Once a Pikachu is encountered, switch to a catching strategy.
3.  **Implement Pokeball Tracking:** Implement a system to track the number of Pokeballs available.
4.  **Basic Move Selection:** Implement a basic move selection system (e.g., always select Tackle, or select the most effective move).
5.  **Coordinate Tracking Improvement:** Resolve coordinate tracking issues. Even approximate coordinates would significantly improve exploration.
6.  **Consider Healing:** While current HP is acceptable, monitor closely. If HP drops significantly, consider returning to Viridian City PC for healing, and tracking `needs_healing` properly.
