# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report: Viridian Forest Expedition

**Report Date:** Current Date (Based on Turn 24)

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest (Currently engaged in a battle)
*   **Lead Pokémon HP:** Full (24/24)
*   **Battle Status:** Engaged in battle.
*   **Opponent:** Kakuna
*   **Poké Balls:** Unknown (Need to determine stock)
*   **Needs Healing:** No
*   **Coordinates:** Unknown (Need to improve location tracking)

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 15-24)

Over the last ten turns, the primary activity has been engaging in repetitive battles.  The encountered opponent has *consistently* been **Kakuna**.  The selected strategy has been to enter the "Fight" menu and use the first available move, presumably to defeat the Kakuna.

**Summary:**

*   **Repeated Encounters:** Faced *ten consecutive* Kakuna battles.
*   **Consistent Strategy:** Selecting "Fight" -> "First Move" in each battle.
*   **No Change in Status:**  Lead Pokémon HP remains full, and the goal of finding Pikachu remains unmet.
*   **Location Static:** Remains trapped in the same area of viridian forest.

## III. Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Kakuna Abundance:** Kakuna appears to be a very common encounter in this area of Viridian Forest.
*   **Lack of Progress:** The current strategy, while safe (due to the lead Pokémon not taking damage), is not advancing the primary goal.
*   **Location Tracking:** The absence of coordinate data is hindering progress.  We need to implement a method to track movement and exploration.
*   **Pikachu Absence:**  Despite significant time spent in Viridian Forest, no Pikachu has been encountered yet. This might indicate:
    *   Pikachu is rare.
    *   We are in the wrong area of Viridian Forest.
    *   We need to use a different strategy to trigger Pikachu encounters.

## IV. Next Objectives & Strategic Adjustments

1.  **Prioritize Location Tracking:** Implement a method to track coordinates within Viridian Forest. This will help map the explored areas and identify patterns in Pokémon encounters.
2.  **Vary Exploration:** The current strategy of staying in the same general area has yielded only Kakuna encounters.  We need to:
    *   **Move Consistently:** After each battle, take a few steps in a random (or strategic) direction to explore new areas.
    *   **Consider Repel (If Available):** If Repels are available, they could be used to avoid battles temporarily and explore more efficiently. However, consider the tradeoffs with potential XP gain.
3.  **Refine Battle Strategy (Long-Term):** While our lead Pokémon's HP is currently full, we should consider optimizing the battle strategy. Determine which moves are most effective against common Viridian Forest Pokémon to minimize future damage.
4.  **Poké Ball Inventory:** Determine how many Poké Balls we possess. We don't want to encounter a Pikachu and be unable to catch it!
5.  **Adjust Search Parameters:** Research where Pikachu is *most likely* to be found in Viridian Forest. Focus exploration on those areas.

**Urgent Task:** Break the Kakuna loop.  The current state is unsustainable and prevents progress toward the Pikachu hunting goal.

## V. Risks & Mitigation

*   **Wasting Resources:** The repetitive battles, while not immediately dangerous, consume time and resources (Potions, PP restoratives, if needed later). The varied exploration is to make sure we don't waste resources on unwanted battles.
*   **Low Morale (AI):** Repetitive tasks can lead to suboptimal decision-making by the AI. Regular progress reports and varied tasks can help mitigate this.
