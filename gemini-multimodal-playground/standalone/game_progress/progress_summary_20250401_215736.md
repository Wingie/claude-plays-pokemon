# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:** In battle with a Rattata. Charmander is at 18/27 HP. Heading towards Viridian City to find the blue-roofed Poké Mart is still the main objective.

**Recent Actions (Turns 85-94):**

*   Engaged in battle.
*   Experienced repeated confusion/errors navigating the Pokémon info screen and battle menu.
*   Finally returned to the battle screen after multiple attempts.
*   Currently selecting the "FIGHT" option to attack.

**Key Discoveries/Observations:**

*   **Menu Navigation Issues:** The player is struggling with basic menu navigation, particularly exiting the Pokémon summary screen and selecting options within the battle menu (choosing "FIGHT" or "CANCEL"). This suggests a need for more deliberate button presses and a better understanding of the interface.
*   **Rattata Encounter:** Battling a Rattata suggests the player is still in the early areas of the game, likely on Route 1 or Route 2.
*   **Low Charmander HP:** Charmander's HP is relatively low (18/27), indicating it has taken some damage, and may need healing soon.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Menu Confusion:** Consistent difficulty navigating menus is causing delays and potentially leading to suboptimal battle decisions.
*   **Low Health:** Charmander's low HP poses a risk during battles.

**Strategies Employed (and their apparent success):**

*   Attempting to exit the Pokémon info screen by pressing 'B' (Correct).
*   Attempting to select "CANCEL" from the "Choose Pokémon or CANCEL" screen to continue fighting (Correct).

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Defeat the Rattata:** Successfully choose "FIGHT" and defeat the Rattata.
2.  **Heal Charmander (if necessary):**  Assess Charmander's HP after the battle. If low, prioritize healing, either with items or by returning to the Pokémon Center.
3.  **Navigate to Viridian City:** Continue heading north towards Viridian City.
4.  **Find the Poké Mart:** Locate the Poké Mart with the blue roof in Viridian City.

**Insights/Recommendations:**

*   **Menu Mastery:**  Focus on understanding the menu structure and button functions to reduce errors. Practice exiting screens and selecting options.
*   **Healing Priority:** Keep an eye on Charmander's HP and heal when necessary to avoid being knocked out.
*   **Strategic Battles:** Conserve Charmander's HP where possible by avoiding unnecessary battles or switching to another Pokémon if available (though none currently equipped).
