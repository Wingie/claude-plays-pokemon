# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Level up Pikachu through battles.

**Current Status:**

*   Engaged in a battle against a wild Caterpie.
*   Battle menu is now visible. Move selection is active.
*   Pikachu's HP: 14/20.
*   Pikachu's available moves: GROWL, THUNDERSHOCK, TAIL WHIP.

**Recent Actions (Turns 20-29):**

*   Encountered a wild Caterpie (Turns 20-28). Initial turns focused on advancing dialogue by repeatedly pressing "A" to reach the move selection screen. We were stuck for several turns simply advancing the dialogue of the encounter.
*   Finally reached the move selection screen (Turn 29).

**Key Discoveries & Insights:**

*   **Encountered a Caterpie:** Found a wild Caterpie, a relatively weak Pokémon ideal for leveling up.
*   **Dialogue Progression:** The initial phase of the battle requires multiple "A" button presses to advance the dialogue and reveal the battle menu.
*   **Move Selection:** We have access to several moves with Pikachu, including GROWL, THUNDERSHOCK, and TAIL WHIP.
*   **Low Health:** Pikachu's health is low (14/20), so healing should be considered after this battle.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Stuck in Initial Dialogue Loop:** Encountered a persistent issue where the game required multiple presses of the "A" button to progress beyond the initial encounter dialogue. This caused multiple repeated turns.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Execute Attack:** Select "THUNDERSHOCK" to attack Caterpie, aiming to defeat it quickly. This will likely require pressing the RIGHT button to select the move, then pressing "A" to confirm the selection.
2.  **Assess Post-Battle Condition:** After defeating Caterpie, evaluate Pikachu's health.
3.  **Healing (Conditional):** If Pikachu's HP is critically low, visit the Pokémon Center to heal.
4.  **Continue Leveling:** Continue engaging in battles with wild Pokémon (prioritizing Caterpie or similarly weak opponents) to level up Pikachu.

**Strategic Considerations:**

*   **Prioritize Offense:** Focus on using "THUNDERSHOCK" for quick wins, given Pikachu's current low health.
*   **Conserve Resources:** Avoid unnecessary damage to Pikachu, as healing resources may be limited.
*   **Monitor Health:** Keep a close eye on Pikachu's health and prioritize healing when necessary to prevent fainting.
