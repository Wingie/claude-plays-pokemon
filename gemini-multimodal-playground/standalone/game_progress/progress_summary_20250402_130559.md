# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find and Win Pokémon Battles

## Current Status

We are currently exploring the overworld, engaging in Pokémon battles as frequently as possible. Progress has been made in encountering and attempting to defeat wild Pokémon. However, we have also experienced instances of needing to access the item menu and, in one instance, failing to win a battle (Pokémon got away). Our Pokémon, HAN, has a healthy HP level (19/19 in the most recent reported battle), indicating we are not currently struggling significantly with battle damage.

## Recent Actions

* **Exploration:** Initial exploration involved walking through tall grass to trigger encounters.
* **Battles:**  Engaged in multiple battles, primarily against Rattata and Pidgey. The primary strategy is to use the first available attack option repeatedly.
* **Item Menu Interaction:** Accessed the item menu, with a potion selected, seemingly for healing purposes (though the potion was not used based on reports).  There were issues with entering and exiting this menu.
* **Encounter Failure:** One encounter resulted in our Pokémon fleeing.

## Key Discoveries

* **Common Encounters:** Rattata and Pidgey appear to be common Pokémon in the current area.
* **Basic Battle Strategy:** Relying on the first available attack appears to be the initial approach to battles.
* **Potion Access:** Access to potions is available, but efficient use is currently lacking.

## Challenges

* **Repetitive Actions:** The reports indicate a repetitive pattern of selecting the first attack option without considering alternative strategies.
* **Inefficient Item Use:** We are selecting potions, but not actually using them during battles when necessary. There are also issues with navigating into/out of the item menu.
* **Failed Encounters:** One encounter ended without a victory, highlighting the need for more strategic battle decisions.

## Next Objectives

1. **Optimize Battle Strategy:** Instead of blindly selecting the first attack, we need to analyze the effectiveness of different attacks against different Pokémon types. Introduce type matchups.
2. **Implement Item Usage:** Develop a clear trigger for using potions during battles (e.g., when HP falls below a certain threshold). Focus on immediately using potions after entering the item menu.
3. **Explore Different Areas:** Consider moving to new areas to encounter a wider variety of Pokémon. This may lead to more challenging battles and better experience gains.
4. **Investigate Item Menu Navigation:** Ensure correct button presses for navigating in and out of item menu.
5. **Capture Pokémon:** Start attempting to catch Pokémon to expand our team. Rattata and Pidgey are common, so they may be good initial targets.
