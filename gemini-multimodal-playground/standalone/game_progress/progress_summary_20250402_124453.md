# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on submission context)
**Trainer:** (Assumed: Player's Character)
**Current Pokémon:** Pidgey (Level 5)

## Current Status

The trainer is currently in the overworld, located at position (5, 11). Pidgey is now Level 5 and has learned the move Sand-Attack. The trainer is actively seeking wild Pokémon battles to gain experience and further develop their skills.

## Recent Actions (Turns 90-99)

*   **Victorious Battle:** Successfully defeated a Wild Pidgey, resulting in experience gain and a level up for our Pidgey.
*   **Level Up:** Pidgey leveled up to Level 5.
*   **New Move Learned:** Pidgey learned the move Sand-Attack. This new move could potentially be useful for lowering the accuracy of opponents in future battles.
*   **Exploration:** The trainer has been attempting to move north from their current location (5, 11) to explore new areas and encounter wild Pokémon.  However, the repeated descriptions suggest the character might be stuck or failing to actually move north.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Leveling Mechanics:** Demonstrated the standard experience point gain and level-up process after winning battles.
*   **Move Acquisition:** Pidgey learned Sand-Attack upon reaching Level 5, highlighting the game's level-based move learning system.
*   **Overworld Environment:** The trainer is currently surrounded by trees on the right and bottom, with an opening to the north. This limits movement options but provides a clear direction for exploration.
*   **Navigation Issue:** The player appears to be having difficulty moving north despite intending to do so across multiple turns. This suggests a potential obstacle (e.g., invisible wall, misinterpretation of controls).

## Next Objectives

1.  **Resolve Navigation Issue:** The immediate priority is to determine why the trainer is not moving north from position (5, 11) despite repeated attempts. Check for obstructions, and confirm input accuracy.
2.  **Find and Engage in Battles:** The primary goal remains to find and engage in battles to continue leveling up Pidgey. Focus on exploring the area north of the current location once the movement issue is resolved.
3.  **Utilize Sand-Attack:** Experiment with Sand-Attack in battle to assess its effectiveness and incorporate it into battle strategy.
4.  **Identify and Capture More Pokémon:** Once Pidgey is sufficiently leveled, consider exploring options for capturing additional Pokémon to diversify the team and provide tactical flexibility.

## Challenges & Strategies

*   **Challenge:** Potential difficulty in navigating the overworld (trainer getting stuck).
*   **Strategy:** Carefully examine the environment, confirm controls are functioning correctly, and potentially try different movement directions if forward progress is impeded.  If still stuck, consult a walkthrough or online resources for guidance.
