# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Expedition

**Date:** 2023-10-27 (Simulated)

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest
*   **Progress:** Wandering in tall grass, encountering wild Pokémon. We are currently in a battle with a Caterpie, but also battled a Weedle previously.
*   **Lead Pokémon HP:** 29/31 (Not critical, healing not immediately required).
*   **Pikachu Status:** Not yet found.
*   **Poké Balls:** Unknown (need to determine quantity available).

## II. Recent Actions & Observations

*   **Initial Exploration (Turns 0-2):** Initially, the strategy involved randomly moving through tall grass to trigger wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Wild Encounters:** We encountered a Weedle (Turns 3-4) and are currently battling a Caterpie (Turns 14-18).
*   **Battle Strategy:** During battles, the primary action was to press 'A', indicating a generic attack. A more refined battle strategy based on move effectiveness will be required for tougher opponents.
*   **Battle Text Loop (Turns 14-18):** The game is stuck in a battle narration loop, repeatedly showing battle text. The bot is correctly pressing 'A' to progress through the text. We need to identify when the text is finished to be able to move on and select a move.

## III. Key Discoveries & Challenges

*   **Viridian Forest Encounters:** The forest is populated by common Bug-type Pokémon like Weedle and Caterpie. Pikachu remains elusive.
*   **Lack of Battle Information:** The lack of detailed information on our Pokémon's moves and their effectiveness is hindering strategic battle decisions.
*   **Battle Progression Issue:** The bot seems to be stuck in a Battle_Text loop. This means it is not progressing past the initial text prompts during a battle. This needs to be fixed so that a real battle is properly simulated.
*   **Poké Ball Count:** The current number of Poké Balls is unknown, making it difficult to assess our catching capability.

## IV. Next Objectives & Strategy

1.  **Resolve Battle Progression:** Investigate and fix the battle progression issue. The bot needs to recognize the end of a battle narration text and then be able to make a move selection.
2.  **Refine Battle Strategy:** Implement a more sophisticated battle strategy. This includes:
    *   **Move Information:** Obtain and integrate information about the player Pokémon's moves, including type, power, and accuracy.
    *   **Type Effectiveness:** Implement a type effectiveness chart to choose the most effective moves against different Pokémon types.
    *   **Prioritization:** Prioritize moves that can quickly defeat opponents.
3.  **Pikachu Search Persistence:** Continue exploring Viridian Forest, prioritizing areas known to have higher Pikachu spawn rates (if such information is available).
4.  **Inventory Check:** Determine the number of Poké Balls available. This will help inform decisions about when to attempt to catch a Pokémon.
5.  **HP Monitoring:** Implement a more robust HP monitoring system. Automatically flee when HP is too low. Determine when to go to the pokemon center for healing.

## V. Action Items

*   **Code Review:** Review the code responsible for battle progression and identify the cause of the "Battle_Text" loop issue.
*   **Data Integration:** Integrate a Pokémon move database and type effectiveness chart.
*   **Logic Implementation:** Implement the refined battle strategy, including move selection based on type effectiveness and HP thresholds for healing or fleeing.
*   **Poké Ball Inventory:** Develop a method to track and update the number of Poké Balls.
