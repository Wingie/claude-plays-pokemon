# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up our Pokémon

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently engaged in wild Pokémon battles (likely in an early route or Viridian Forest).
*   **Pokémon Health:** Pikachu is our active Pokémon and is consistently taking damage during battles. Pikachu's HP is currently low and `needs_healing = true`.
*   **Battle State:** Actively battling wild Pokémon, specifically Weedle.
*   **Moveset:** Pikachu's moveset includes GROWL, THUNDERSHOCK, and TAIL WHIP.

## Recent Actions (Turns 39-48)

*   **Engaging in Battles:** The last ten turns have been primarily focused on battling Weedle in the wild.
*   **Move Selection:** Consistently selecting THUNDERSHOCK as the preferred offensive move.
*   **Dialogue Advancement:** Repeatedly advancing dialogue after each attack from both our Pokémon and the opponent.
*   **Acknowledged Need for Healing:** The AI identified that Pikachu is consistently low HP and needs to be healed soon.

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Weedle Encounters:** The primary wild Pokémon encountered recently are Weedle, suggesting that our current location is within an area where Weedle are common.
*   **Offensive Strategy:** The current strategy revolves around using THUNDERSHOCK as the primary attack, which is effective against Weedle.
*   **Pikachu's Low HP:** Pikachu is taking a significant amount of damage during battles. This presents a challenge for leveling up and requires immediate attention.
*   **Ineffectiveness of Growl:** Using Growl has been ineffective as it doesn't cause damage to the opponent.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Prioritize Healing:** Given that Pikachu's health is consistently low, we MUST prioritize healing. We will need to access the BAG during battle and use a Potion. Or we need to return to the nearest pokemon center.
2.  **Continue Leveling:** Continue battling wild Pokémon to gain experience and level up Pikachu. If the number of potions is too high, avoid battles until we can return to the Pokecenter to heal.
3.  **Consider Move Alternatives:** While THUNDERSHOCK is effective, explore the potential of using other moves strategically. Could Tailwind provide benefits, or would using items work better?
4.  **Progress Through the Route/Area:** Once Pikachu is adequately leveled and healed, we should proceed to explore the current route/area and potentially move on to new locations.
5.  **Navigate Safely:** Carefully monitor Pikachu's health and avoid unnecessary battles until a healing strategy is implemented.
