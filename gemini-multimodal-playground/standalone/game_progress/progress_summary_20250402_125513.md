# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Game Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles to learn how to fight.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, Tall Grass (Position 6, 11)
*   **Objective:** Actively searching for Pokémon battles within tall grass.
*   **State:** Just finished a battle.

## Recent Actions (Turns 0-99)

*   **Initial Turns (0-4):** Repeatedly moved within tall grass in an attempt to trigger Pokémon battles. Pressed "left" in Turn 4.
*   **Turns 5-94:** (Information missing for Turns 5-94, but likely involved more movement within tall grass)
*   **Turn 95:** Completed a battle successfully. Changed strategy to avoid looping and moved in a new direction.
*   **Turns 96-99:** Continued moving left within the tall grass after realizing its potential for spawning battles.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Tall Grass = Battles:**  The tall grass is confirmed as a reliable location to trigger Pokémon battles.
*   **Location Awareness:** The game state provides coordinates (6, 11), indicating an understanding of positional awareness within the game world.
*   **Strategic Adaptation:** The agent identified a potential looping issue (repeatedly moving in the same small area) and attempted to mitigate it by changing direction after a battle.
*   **Resource Recognition:** The bot understands that winning battles will allow it to learn how to fight.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Information Gap:** Significant information is missing for turns 5-94. This makes it difficult to fully assess progress during this period.
*   **Looping Behavior (Potential):** Initial strategy of simply moving within the tall grass may have led to inefficient exploration and repeated battles in the same area.

## Next Objectives

*   **Continue Moving Left:** Continue to move to the left to find more battles.
*   **Monitor Battle Frequency:** Observe how often battles occur while moving left to determine the effectiveness of the strategy.
*   **Record Battle Outcomes:** Note the results of each battle (win/loss) to track learning progress.
*   **Explore Alternatives if Necessary:** If battles become infrequent moving left, explore other directions from the current location. Consider using a systematic approach to exploration (e.g., move north, east, south, west in sequence).
*   **Improve Turn Logging:** Ensure that all turns are recorded in the game log, to better track the agent's progress and thought process.
