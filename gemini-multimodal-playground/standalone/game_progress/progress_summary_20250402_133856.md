# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore the world, encounter and catch a Pikachu, and level up Pokémon to level 10-15.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Route 2 (just outside Viridian City)
*   **Lead Pokémon:** Pidgey (Level 8, HP: 2/25)
*   **Team Status:** Critically low health. Needs immediate healing.
*   **Pikachu Encountered:** No

## Recent Actions (Turns 65-74)

The primary focus of the last ten turns has been surviving encounters on Route 2 while attempting to level up our Pidgey. We entered the tall grass with the intention of finding a Pikachu and leveling up our team. However, we encountered several wild Pidgeys, leading to numerous battles. These battles highlighted a critical vulnerability: our Pidgey's rapidly depleting HP.

*   **Turn 65:** Initialized exploration of Route 2, focusing on tall grass for wild encounters.
*   **Turns 66-73:** Engaged in multiple battles with wild Pidgeys (Level 3). Our Pidgey (Level 8) relied primarily on Tackle.  We realized the importance of tracking and managing our Pidgey's health. As HP dwindled, we tried to run from battles when HP was critical to avoid fainting.
*   **Turn 74:** Successfully escaped a battle and are now in the overworld, prioritizing returning to the Viridian City Pokémon Center for healing.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Resource Management (HP):** Health management is crucial, especially when attempting to level up in areas with frequent encounters. 30% HP threshold was set as the critical point in deciding wheter to heal or continue fighting,
*   **Battle Mechanics:**  We have gained some familiarity with basic battle commands (Fight, Run) and the use of Tackle and Sand-Attack.  We now need to better understand the effectiveness of different move types.
*   **Route 2 Dangers:** Route 2 is teeming with Pidgeys, which can quickly whittle down a Pokémon's health.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Low HP Management:**  Continual battles with Pidgeys significantly reduced our Pidgey's health, forcing us to prioritize survival over exploration and leveling.
*   **Lack of Healing Items:** We currently lack healing items such as Potions, which would allow us to recover HP during exploration.
*   **Pikachu Elusiveness:** Despite searching the tall grass, we have not yet encountered a Pikachu.
*  **Limited Move-set:** The lead Pokemon has only Tackle as a reliable offensive move.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Immediate Healing:** Return to the Pokémon Center in Viridian City to fully heal our Pidgey.
2.  **Acquire Healing Items:** Purchase Potions from the Poke Mart in Viridian City to maintain Pokémon health during exploration.
3.  **Continue Pikachu Search:** Once healed and equipped with healing items, return to Route 2 and continue the search for a Pikachu.
4.  **Improve Battle Strategy:**  Learn the effects of all available moves for the lead pokemon.
