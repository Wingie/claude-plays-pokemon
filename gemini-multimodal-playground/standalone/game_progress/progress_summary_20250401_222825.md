# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Attempting to navigate north towards Viridian City.
*   Repeatedly encountering and battling a wild Rattata, hindering progress.
*   Objective remains: Locate the Poké Mart with the blue roof in Viridian City.

**Recent Actions (Turns 1-14):**

*   Engaged in multiple battles with a wild Rattata.
*   Primarily used Charmander's "Scratch" attack initially.
*   Later transitioned to using "Ember" attack after realizing its effectiveness against the Normal-type Rattata.
*   Repeatedly attempted to move North (Up direction) after defeating the Rattata.

**Key Discoveries & Observations:**

*   Encountering the same wild Rattata repeatedly, indicating a potential looping issue or very high encounter rate in the immediate area.
*   "Ember" attack is more effective against the wild Rattata than "Scratch".
*   Progress is being severely limited by the frequent Rattata encounters.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Repetitive Battles:** The primary obstacle is the extremely frequent encounters with the same Rattata, preventing forward movement.
*   **Navigational Blockage:** The persistent re-encounter suggests a game mechanic or specific map layout preventing uninterrupted movement.

**Strategies & Analysis:**

*   **Initial Strategy (Scratch):** Starting with "Scratch" was a logical initial choice, but inefficient.
*   **Adapted Strategy (Ember):** Switching to "Ember" proved more effective in quickly defeating the Rattata.
*   **Navigation:** The repetitive loop of battle and moving up shows a need to alter the path to Viridian City. There might be a need to move left or right to avoid continuous Rattata encounters.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Break the Rattata Loop:** Attempt alternative routes (e.g., moving slightly left or right before moving north) to avoid triggering the same wild encounter.
2.  **Reach Viridian City:** Prioritize reaching Viridian City and its Poké Mart to advance the main story.
3.  **Utilize Effective Attacks:** Continue using "Ember" against Normal-type Pokémon to optimize battle speed.
4.  **Explore Route Options:** If necessary, investigate alternative routes to Viridian City if the current path remains blocked.
