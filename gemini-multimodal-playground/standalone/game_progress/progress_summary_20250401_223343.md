# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Navigate to Viridian City and locate the blue-roofed PokéMart.

## Current Status

Currently located just south of Viridian City, near the edge of the forest. Progress is impeded by a ledge blocking the direct path north and a non-player character (NPC) positioned near the ledge.

## Recent Actions (Turns 41-54)

The primary focus has been navigating around the ledge and NPC to reach Viridian City. Initial attempts involved circling the ledge by moving left and then up. These proved unsuccessful, potentially due to pathing errors or other unseen obstacles. Later attempts focused on moving right to circumvent the ledge and the person blocking the way.
Recent actions include:
   -repeatedly moving right to go around a person.
   -trying to break out of loops by going left and up
   -trying going right

## Key Discoveries

*   **Ledge Obstacle:** A ledge directly blocks the path north, preventing direct access to Viridian City.
*   **NPC Obstruction:** An NPC stands near the ledge, further complicating navigation.
*   **Ineffective Initial Strategy:** Attempting to go left around the ledge initially proved unsuccessful.
*   **Potential for Rightward Route:** Moving to the right appears to be a more promising approach for circumventing the obstacles.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Rightward Movement:** Persist with moving to the right to fully bypass the ledge and NPC.
2.  **Navigate North:** Once clear of the obstacles, proceed north towards Viridian City.
3.  **Locate the PokéMart:** Upon reaching Viridian City, prioritize finding the PokéMart with the blue roof.
4.  **Evaluate Alternative Routes:** If the rightward path becomes problematic, re-evaluate the situation and explore other potential routes around the ledge, considering possible alternative paths through the forest itself.
