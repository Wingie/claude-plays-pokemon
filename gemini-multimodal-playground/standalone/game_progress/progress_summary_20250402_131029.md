# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

*   Our lead Pokémon is currently at 9/21 HP.
*   Recently finished a battle and gained experience.
*   `needs_healing` is currently `False` (HP is above 30% of maximum).

## Recent Actions (Turns 25-34)

*   Engaged in a series of battles, consistently selecting "FIGHT" and the first available move.
*   Monitored HP level, triggering a temporary `needs_healing` flag when HP dropped below 30% of maximum (6.3 HP).
*   After the most recent battle concluded, the `needs_healing` flag was reset to `False` as HP was above the threshold.
*   Following the last battle, the decision was made to move right in the hope of encountering more tall grass and triggering another battle.

## Key Discoveries & Observations

*   **HP Management:** The bot successfully monitors the lead Pokémon's HP and initiates a `needs_healing` flag when it drops below 30%. This flag prioritizes healing, but the bot continues fighting the current battle before seeking healing.
*   **Post-Battle Logic:** The bot correctly identifies when a battle has concluded and re-evaluates the `needs_healing` flag.
*   **Exploration Strategy:** After a battle and when no healing is needed, the bot defaults to moving right, presumably in search of more encounters in tall grass.
*   **Inconsistent Math**: There was a slight error in turn 33 when calculating needs_healing status. It incorrectly reported needing to heal, then fixed it in turn 34.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Locate and Engage in More Battles:** Continue moving right to find tall grass and trigger new Pokémon battles.
2.  **Maintain HP Awareness:** Continue monitoring HP and ensuring the `needs_healing` flag is accurately set to prioritize healing when necessary.
3.  **Address Inconsistent Math**: Continue monitoring needs_healing logic due to errors in previous turns.
4.  **Develop a more robust exploration strategy**: Moving right after battles is rudimentary. Is there an algorithm that will more efficiently find pokemon battles?
