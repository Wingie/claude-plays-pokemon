# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 27, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest (Assumed based on wild encounters)
*   **Battle Status:** Not currently in battle.
*   **Lead Pokémon:**  Healthy (Based on HP readings - no need for immediate healing).
*   **Poké Balls:** Unknown Quantity - Need to determine and track this.
*   **Progress Summary:**  We have been repeatedly encountering and defeating Weedle in Viridian Forest. We are clearing battle summaries and preparing for the next encounter. We have not yet encountered a Pikachu.

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 2-11)

*   **Turn 2-7:** Engaged in battle repeatedly with wild Weedle.  The strategy employed was to select the first available move ("A" -> "A").
*   **Turns 8-11:** Cleared the battle summary screens following Weedle defeats.

## III. Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Dominant Pokémon:** Weedle are common in our current location within Viridian Forest.
*   **Battle Strategy:**  The "A" -> "A" battle strategy is effective against Weedle.
*   **Information Gap:** We are missing critical information like the number of Poké Balls available.
*   **Repetitive Encounters:**  The gameplay loop has become repetitive, suggesting we might need to change tactics or explore different areas of the forest.

## IV. Challenges Faced

*   **Repetitive Battles:** The constant Weedle encounters are hindering progress towards finding a Pikachu.
*   **Lack of Information:**  The absence of data on Poké Ball count limits our ability to plan strategically for catching a Pikachu once encountered.

## V. Next Objectives

1.  **Inventory Check:**  Prioritize determining and tracking the number of Poké Balls available.
2.  **Pikachu Search Optimization:** Modify strategy.
    * Strategy A: Continue encountering wild Pokémon but be ready to throw a pokéball if the Pokémon is a pikachu.
    * Strategy B: Explore different areas within Viridian Forest to increase the likelihood of encountering a Pikachu. This may involve random directional inputs to simulate exploration.
3.  **Conditional Action (Pikachu Encountered):** If a Pikachu is encountered, throw a Poké Ball to attempt capture.
4. **Conditional Action (Pikachu Low HP):** If a Pikachu is encountered and low HP, throw a Poké Ball to attempt capture.

## VI. Future Plans

*   **Team Diversity:** Once a Pikachu is caught, consider diversifying the team with other Pokémon found in Viridian Forest.
*   **Gym Challenge Preparation:** After leaving Viridian Forest, begin preparing for the first gym battle in Pewter City.
