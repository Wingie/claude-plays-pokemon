# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 65-74

## Current Status

*   **Objective:** Level up Pokémon (Primary).
*   **In-Battle:** Yes (`is_in_battle = true`, `battle_menu_visible = true`).
*   **Pikachu's HP:** 11/20
*   **Needs Healing:** Yes (`needs_healing = true`). Pikachu's HP is consistently below 30%.
*   **Stuck in a Loop:**  Facing difficulty escaping the current battle.

## Recent Actions

The last ten turns (65-74) have been focused on attempting to escape a battle in order to heal Pikachu. The same actions have been repeatedly attempted:

*   Selecting "RUN" from the battle menu (achieved by pressing Down twice, followed by A).
*   These attempts have consistently failed.

## Key Discoveries / Insights

*   **Escape Failure:** Despite repeatedly attempting to run, the escape attempt has been unsuccessful, indicating a possible mechanical issue, very low speed stat, or a move preventing escape.
*   **Consistent HP Condition:** Pikachu's HP remains consistently low (11/20), indicating constant re-entry into battles or inability to heal between them.
*   **Loop Detection:** The agent recognizes that it is in a loop.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Analyze Escape Failure:** Determine why running away is consistently failing. Possible reasons include:
    *   Is the "RUN" command actually being executed correctly?  Verify input.
    *   Are there game mechanics (e.g., abilities, items used by the opponent) preventing escape?
    *   Is Pikachu's Speed stat too low to reliably escape?
2.  **Alternate Escape Strategies:** If "RUN" consistently fails, consider alternative strategies *within* the battle:
    *   **Use an Item:** Check the BAG for a Potion or other healing item to restore Pikachu's HP.  If available, use it.
    *   **Switch Pokémon:** If another Pokémon is in the party with higher HP, consider switching to that Pokémon to avoid a knockout.
    *   **Fight (as a Last Resort):** If escape is impossible, prioritize using attacking moves.  While risky, it might be the only way to end the battle and allow for healing afterwards.

3.  **If Escape is Achieved:**
    *   **Heal Pikachu:**  Use a Potion or visit a Pokémon Center to fully restore Pikachu's HP.
    *   **Resume Leveling:** Return to the original objective of leveling up Pokémon once Pikachu is healthy.

## Prioritized Action

Given the consistent failure of the "RUN" command, the **immediate priority is to determine why the escape attempts are failing and to find an alternative way to get out of the battle.** This is preventing progress on the primary objective of leveling up. Begin with inspecting the BAG and trying to use a potion.
