# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   **Objective:** Explore the world and encounter a Pikachu. Also, level up the current Pokémon.
*   **Location:** Overworld, likely near tall grass (uncertain due to limited positional information).
*   **In-Game State:** Not currently in a battle, but recently emerged from a successful encounter with a Pidgey.

**Recent Actions and Observations:**

*   **Turns 10-12:** Repeated attempts to trigger wild Pokémon encounters by moving in tall grass. This suggests a lack of efficient exploration strategy.
*   **Turns 13-19:** Engaged in a battle with a wild Pidgey. Initial confusion regarding available moves.
    *   Initially, a raw button mashing approach was considered.
    *   Later turns show an understanding of using "Tackle" as the primary offensive move.
    *   Successfully defeated the Pidgey, gaining 15 EXP.
*   **Turns 8-9:** Focused on exiting the battle screen and returning to the overworld to continue the search for Pikachu.

**Key Discoveries and Learnings:**

*   **Battle Mechanics:** Confirmed the mechanics of wild Pokémon battles, including move selection and experience gain. The character currently understand the usage of moves like "Tackle"
*   **Overworld Navigation:**  Navigating the overworld relies heavily on random movement to trigger encounters. A better strategy involving identifying specific areas known for Pikachu spawns (if available) is needed.
*   **Available Actions:** Limited understanding of all available actions within the game, such as accessing the party menu, using items, or checking the map.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Lack of Positional Awareness:** The inability to pinpoint exact location within the game world hinders strategic exploration.
*   **Limited Move Information:** The character is unsure about his Pokemon's move set.
*   **Inconsistent Battle Strategy:** Initially unsure of the best actions to take during battles, but learning as more turns are played.

**Next Objectives and Action Plan:**

1.  **Exiting the Battle Screen:** Press "A" repeatedly to completely exit the battle screen and return to the overworld map.
2.  **Improve Exploration Strategy:**
    *   Move out of the tall grass and attempt to identify landmarks or signs that provide positional context.
    *   If possible, consult external resources (walkthroughs, maps) to determine the area where Pikachu is most likely to be found.
3.  **Maximize Encounter Rate:** If Pikachu location is unknown, continue searching in tall grass, but consider varying the direction and patterns of movement to avoid stagnation.
4.  **Develop Battle Strategy:**
    *   Pay closer attention to the available moves and their effects.
    *   Prioritize moves that deal damage over those that inflict status conditions (for now).
    *   Heal pokemon if their HP drops low
