# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find wild Pokémon battles and attempt to catch them.

## Current Status

We are currently exploring the overworld, seeking opportunities to battle and catch wild Pokémon. Our Charmander has leveled up significantly due to recent battles. We briefly entered a Pokémon Center.

## Recent Actions

*   **Movement & Exploration:** Navigated through the overworld, exploring paths with trees, buildings (including a Pokémon Center), and NPCs. Coordinates were recorded as (2,11) at some point.
*   **Battling:** Engaged in at least one battle with a Pidgey, which resulted in the Pidgey fainting.
*   **Leveling Up:** Charmander leveled up to level 10, gaining EXP.
*   **Pokémon Center Visit:** Briefly entered a Pokémon Center and then exited.
*   **Addressing Stuck Input:** Corrected a loop of pressing 'A' after battles, which had stalled progress.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Pokémon Center Identification:** Successfully identified a building as a Pokémon Center based on its layout and Nurse Joy's presence.
*   **Wild Pokémon Location:** Identified tall grass as the probable location for finding wild Pokémon and adjusted movement accordingly.
*   **Overworld Elements:** Discovered various overworld elements, including paths, trees, buildings, and NPCs.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Stuck Input Loop:** Got stuck in a loop of pressing 'A' after battles. This was identified and resolved.
*   **Navigation:** Avoiding obstacles such as signs while navigating the overworld.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Return to Tall Grass:** Re-enter the tall grass located at the bottom of the current area to reliably encounter wild Pokémon.
2.  **Engage in Battles:** Actively seek out and engage in battles with wild Pokémon to gain experience and levels.
3.  **Catch Wild Pokémon:** Attempt to catch wild Pokémon to expand our team.
4.  **Continued Exploration:** Explore the overworld to discover new areas, items, and trainers.
