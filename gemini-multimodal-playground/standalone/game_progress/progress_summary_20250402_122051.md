# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Report Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on provided turns)

## Current Status

*   **Goal:** Growing Mankey (leveling up).
*   **Current Situation:** Mankey is at a low level and experiences health issues in battles. Mankey is at 11/17 health.
*   **Location:** Implied to be in an early game route with wild Pidgey encounters.

## Recent Actions (Turns 85-94)

*   **Repeated Battle Encounters:** Primarily engaging (or attempting to engage) with wild Pidgey.
*   **Failed Battle Attempts:** Several turns (86, 87, 88, 89) indicate issues with input recognition, requiring repeated Pokémon selections in the menu.
*   **Run Strategy:** Employed the "RUN" option frequently when Mankey's health was low. Multiple attempts to run from Pidgey were required.
*   **Successful Battle:** Finally, a successful battle occurred in turn 93, resulting in a fainted Pidgey and experience gain for Mankey.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Input Lag/Recognition Issues:** The game is frequently failing to properly respond to user input, leading to repeated menu selections and delayed actions.
*   **Mankey's Vulnerability:** Mankey is under-leveled and struggling against even basic Pokémon like Pidgey, requiring frequent escapes.
*   **Experience Gain:** A successful battle grants 23 EXP to Mankey.
*   **Game Mechanics:** Confirmation that defeating wild Pokémon yields experience points.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Low Mankey Health:** Mankey's low health is a significant impediment, forcing frequent escapes and hindering progress.
*   **Input Inaccuracy:** The most significant challenge. Repeated and failed turns suggest that inputs are not being properly registered by the game. This needs to be addressed for any meaningful progress.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Troubleshoot Input Issues:** Identify and resolve the problem with input recognition. Consider checking controller connection, emulator settings (if applicable), or the game's code.
2.  **Prioritize Healing:** Ensure Mankey is at full health before engaging in battles, perhaps using potions or Pokémon Center visits (location unknown based on current information).
3.  **Strategic Battles:** Seek out easier or more manageable battles to safely level up Mankey. Consider switching locations to routes with weaker wild Pokémon or using a different strategy.
4.  **Grinding for Levels:** Dedicate time to deliberately battle weaker Pokémon to steadily raise Mankey's level and improve its stats.
