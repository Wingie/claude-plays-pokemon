# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find battles to level up Pokémon and catch new ones, specifically a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, recently on a path north of the starting area. Current position (8,11) is approximate as battles interrupt movement.
*   **Party Leader:** Charmander, Level 9, 22/27 HP (last known).
*   **Battle Status:** Currently engaged in a battle (details unknown).
*   **Progress Toward Goal:** Minimal. Still early in the game, attempting to explore and train.

## Recent Actions

*   **Early Battles:** Engaged in at least one battle with a Level 3 Pidgey. Primary attack used was Scratch.
*   **Exploration:** Explored the overworld, encountering signs, trees, and paths. Focused on moving North to explore a visible path.
*   **Dialog Encounter:** Briefly encountered a dialog screen (presumably related to exploration).
*   **Attempt to Flee:** After restarting the battle, attempted to flee, indicating concern about the Pokémon's health/level relative to opponents.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Overworld Structure:** Identified a basic overworld structure with paths, trees, and signs.
*   **Wild Pidgey Encounters:** Encountered at least one wild Pidgey, indicating common early-game Pokémon.
*   **Battle Mechanics:** Reinforced the use of "A" to continue battle actions.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Escape Current Battle:** Successfully flee from the current battle to preserve Charmander's health and continue exploration.
2.  **Continue Northern Exploration:** Proceed further north along the path to uncover new areas and potential Pikachu locations.
3.  **Manage Resources:** Monitor Charmander's HP and consider healing options (Potions, Pokémon Center) if frequent battles lead to depletion.
4.  **Re-evaluate Training Strategy:** If fleeing becomes necessary in most encounters, consider focusing on easier battles or adjusting team composition.
5.  **Pikachu Search:** Continue the primary objective of locating and catching a Pikachu. Research potential habitats if necessary.
