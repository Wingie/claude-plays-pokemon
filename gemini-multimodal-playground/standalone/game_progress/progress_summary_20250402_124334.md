# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 75-84

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

We are currently exploring a route with tall grass and a path leading upwards. We are engaging in frequent battles with wild Pokémon, primarily Rattata and Pidgey, to gain experience and learn combat mechanics. Our Pidgey is our primary fighter.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turn 75-76:** Successfully defeated two wild Rattata, gaining experience for our Pidgey.
*   **Turn 77:** Broke free from an "A" button loop in the overworld by moving one step up. Location remains unknown but we now have a more reliable navigation.
*   **Turn 78-79:** Continued moving upwards along a path in the tall grass, actively searching for more battles.
*   **Turn 80-84:** Engaged in a battle with a wild Pidgey. Repeatedly selected "Fight" and then "Tackle" as our attack strategy.  The battle is still ongoing. Our Pidgey's health is at 11/17, and the wild Pidgey's health is at 8/17.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Enemy Types:** We are encountering Rattata and Pidgey in the wild, indicating this area is populated by these Pokémon.
*   **Combat Strategy:** We are primarily using Pidgey's "Tackle" attack, which appears to be effective, at least against lower-level Pidgey.
*   **Navigation:** Moving "up" is allowing us to explore a new area.
*   **Overcoming Obstacles:** Simple directional movement can break loops caused by stuck commands.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Unknown Location:** We still lack knowledge of our current location within the game world.
*   **Low Health:** Our Pidgey's health is taking damage during battles. We need to consider healing options soon.
*   **Repetitive Actions:** The constant repetition of selecting "Fight" and "Tackle" suggests the need for a more automated or strategic approach.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Exploring Upwards:** Follow the path upwards to discover new areas and potential landmarks to identify our location.
2.  **Win the Current Pidgey Battle:** Focus on defeating the current wild Pidgey to gain more experience.
3.  **Identify Healing Options:** Once we are out of battle, find a way to restore Pidgey's health (Potions, Pokémon Center).
4.  **Diversify Attack Strategy:** As Pidgey levels up and learns new moves, explore alternative attack options beyond "Tackle".
5.  **Document Location:** When encountering a landmark or sign, record the location for future reference.
