# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and find a Pikachu to catch.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest, Coordinates (4, 7)
*   **Party Leader:** Pidgey, Level 12, HP: 31/33
*   **Overall Progress:** Currently stuck in repeated battles.

## Recent Actions (Turns 38-47)

The last ten turns have been spent in continuous battles against Caterpie in Viridian Forest. In each turn, the game has detected a battle with a Caterpie. The AI's response has been consistent: Analyze the situation, plan to use Tackle with Pidgey, and execute the plan by selecting "Fight" and then "Tackle."

*   **Repeated Encounter:** Every turn, we've encountered a Caterpie.
*   **Consistent Strategy:**  The strategy of using Tackle with Pidgey has been repeatedly employed.
*   **No Progress on Goal:**  Despite the repeated battles, we haven't progressed towards our goal of exploring the forest or finding a Pikachu.

## Key Discoveries & Challenges

*   **High Encounter Rate:**  The encounter rate in the current location is extremely high, making exploration difficult.
*   **Caterpie Predominance:**  Caterpie seems to be the most common Pokémon in this area.
*   **Strategic Limitations:**  Relying solely on Tackle may not be optimal for quickly progressing through the forest.
*   **Possible Loop:**  The consistent repetition of battles suggests a potential loop or lack of progress detection.
* **Unknown Game state:** We are stuck in an endless loop, we don't know the location name, or if we are in tall grass.

## Next Objectives

Given the current situation, we need to re-evaluate our strategy:

1.  **Vary Battle Strategy:** Explore other moves that Pidgey knows.
2.  **Health Management:** Be prepared to use items (Potions) if Pidgey's health gets too low.
3.  **Identify Exit Strategy:** Prioritize finding a path out of the current area to explore more of Viridian Forest.
4.  **Evaluate Alternate Pokemon:** Consider swapping out Pidgey if another pokemon becomes available.
5.  **Examine Game State:** Investigate why the game may be stuck in this state and identify any errors in the process.  Potentially log more comprehensive game state data (like location name).

**Long-Term Objective:** Resume the original goal of exploring Viridian Forest and catching a Pikachu once we escape the Caterpie encounter loop.
