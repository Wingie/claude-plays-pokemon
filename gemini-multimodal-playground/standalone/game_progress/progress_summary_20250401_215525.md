# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Game:** Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Route 1 (approaching Viridian City)
*   **Goal:** Reach Viridian City and find the Poké Mart (blue roof).
*   **Facing:** Navigational challenges and wild Pokémon encounters.

## Recent Actions (Turns 60-69)

*   **Struggling with Navigation:** Initial turns focused on navigating Route 1. Progress was hampered by obstacles such as ledges and trees. Experienced difficulty with movement, with attempts to move north repeatedly failing.
*   **Course Correction:** Adjusted strategy to move left, then up, then right to attempt to navigate around obstacles blocking the path north.
*   **Wild Pokémon Encounter:** Engaged in multiple battles with wild Rattata.
*   **Prioritizing Escape:** Due to the primary goal of reaching Viridian City, the strategy was to immediately attempt to run from the wild Pokémon battles to conserve time and resources.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Route 1 Obstacles:** The path to Viridian City on Route 1 is not a straight shot and contains environmental obstacles (ledges and trees) that require careful maneuvering.
*   **Frequent Wild Encounters:** Wild Pokémon (Rattata) are common in the tall grass of Route 1, leading to interruptions and the need to decide whether to battle or flee.
*   **Run command:** The "RUN" command successfully extracts the trainer from battles, but can be frustrating to manage and adds extra button pushes to navigate.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Navigate Route 1:** Overcome the remaining obstacles on Route 1 to reach Viridian City. Experiment with different movement patterns to find the optimal path.
2.  **Reach Viridian City:** Successfully enter Viridian City.
3.  **Locate Poké Mart:** Find the Poké Mart with the blue roof within Viridian City.
4.  **(Contingent) Consider Encounters:** If wild Pokémon battles are impeding progress too significantly, consider a strategy shift (e.g., using a Pokémon with a status move or simply engaging in battles to level up the starter Pokémon).
