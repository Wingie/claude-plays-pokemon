# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, standing in tall grass.
*   **Pokémon HP:** Currently at 15/21. Above the 30% threshold, so healing is not immediately required.
*   **Objective Status:** Actively attempting to engage in and win Pokémon battles.

## Recent Actions (Turns 65-74)

*   **Turns 65-68:** Navigated the tall grass, taking steps in various directions (left, down, random, right) in an attempt to trigger a Pokémon battle.
*   **Turns 69-74:** Engaged in Pokémon battles. Consistently selected the "FIGHT" option and used the first available move (inferred to be Scratch from turn 74).

## Key Discoveries & Observations

*   **Tall Grass Mechanics:** Tall grass successfully triggers Pokémon battles.
*   **Battle Strategy:** The current strategy is to select "FIGHT" and use the first move ("Scratch").
*   **HP Management:** The Pokémon's HP has decreased slightly during the recent battles (from 18/21 to 15/21). While still above the 30% threshold, continued battles may necessitate healing in the near future.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Seeking Battles:** Remain in the tall grass and continue moving to initiate more Pokémon battles.
2.  **Monitor HP:** Closely monitor the Pokémon's HP and prioritize healing (e.g., using a Potion or returning to a Pokémon Center) if it drops below the 30% threshold.
3.  **Evaluate Battle Strategy:** As the game progresses, evaluate the effectiveness of the current battle strategy ("FIGHT" -> "Scratch"). Consider exploring other moves or strategies if necessary.
