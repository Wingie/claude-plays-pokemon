# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest. Currently in tall grass.
*   **State:** Engaging in repeated battles with Weedle.
*   **Progress Towards Goal:** Minimal progress. We are encountering frequent Weedle battles, hindering the search for Pikachu.

## Recent Actions (Turns 0-14)

1.  **Initial Exploration (Turns 0-1):** Began exploration of Viridian Forest from an unknown location, attempting to enter tall grass based on visual cues (when no coordinates were available). This action was repeated twice.
2.  **Coordinate Acquisition & Navigation (Turns 2-4):** Coordinates were detected at (7, 5). Defined target grass location at (3,4). Initiated movement to the designated grass location by moving left to enter the grass. Repeated this movement three times.
3.  **Weedle Encounters (Turns 10-14):** Entered tall grass and are now facing a series of Weedle battles. Repeatedly selecting attack 'A' due to lack of information regarding optimal moves.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Location Awareness:** Successfully determined the initial location (coordinates 7,5) and can use this information to navigate Viridian Forest.
*   **Dominance of Weedle:** The initial encounters within the tall grass seem to be dominated by Weedle.
*   **Lack of Move Knowledge:** Current strategy is hindered by a lack of information about our Pokémon's moves and their effectiveness against different types.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Repetitive Encounters:** The high frequency of Weedle battles is slowing down the Pikachu hunt considerably.
*   **Inefficient Battle Strategy:** Blindly selecting 'A' to attack is likely inefficient.  We need better information about our Pokémon and their moves.
*   **Coordinate Detection Intermittency:** Turns 0 and 1 did not have coordinate information, which impacts movement.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Prioritize Understanding Move Sets:** Before continuing the Pikachu hunt, gather information about our Pokémon's available moves and their types. Determine the best moves to use against common Viridian Forest Pokémon (especially Weedle).
2.  **Pikachu Prioritization:** Continue exploring the tall grass, focusing specifically on areas where Pikachu might be more likely to appear (if such information is available).
3.  **Resource Management:** Monitor the health of our Pokémon and consider retreating to the Pokécenter if necessary (location at 0,0) to avoid being knocked out. However, Pokécenter not visible yet.
4.  **Coordinate Reliability:** Ensure a constant stream of coordinate updates for faster and more accurate travel in the map.

## Strategy Adjustments

*   **Battle Efficiency:**  Once move information is available, prioritize using moves that are "super effective" against Weedle to minimize the time spent in each battle.
*   **Area Targeting:** If possible, determine areas in Viridian Forest with a higher chance of encountering Pikachu and focus our search there.
