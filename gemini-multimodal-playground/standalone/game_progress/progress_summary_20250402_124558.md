# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Early Game

**Current Status:**

*   Exploring the initial overworld area, specifically focusing on traversing tall grass.
*   Engaged in multiple battles with wild Rattata.
*   Pidgey is at level 5 with 7/19 HP in the most recent battle report.
*   Objective remains consistent: Win battles and learn the battle mechanics.

**Recent Actions:**

*   Repeatedly moved "up" in the overworld, presumably to explore and trigger wild Pokémon encounters.
*   Entered battle sequences triggered by the tall grass.
*   Consistently selected the first battle option (assumed to be an attack) against Rattata.
*   Confirmed familiarity with the "FIGHT" option and pressing "A" to select.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Tall grass is the primary source of wild Pokémon encounters in the starting area.
*   Rattata is a common wild Pokémon in the current location.
*   Confirmed Pidgey is the starter Pokémon, currently at level 5.
*   Low HP of Pidgey indicate that a battle strategy or healing option might be needed soon.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   Low HP of Pidgey presents a potential challenge, as it's vulnerable to fainting.
*   The chosen strategy of "selecting the first option" (attack) hasn't been explicitly successful in securing a swift victory yet (implied by repeated encounters with Rattata).
*   The details of different fight options are not explored.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Secure a Victory:** Focus on defeating a Rattata to gain experience and potentially level up Pidgey.
2.  **Explore Battle Options:** Investigate the other battle options beyond the first attack to determine their effects and strategize more effectively. Analyze the battle menu.
3.  **Manage Pidgey's HP:** Identify and utilize healing items or Pokémon Centers to restore Pidgey's health and prevent fainting.
4.  **Continue Exploration:** Expand exploration beyond moving "up" to discover new areas and Pokémon.
