# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore the world and try to encounter a Pikachu.

**Current Status:**

*   Engaged in multiple battles, primarily against wild Pidgey.
*   Lead Pokémon, "MAN", has been used in battle. HP levels have fluctuated, indicating damage taken from opposing Pokémon.
*   Progress towards the primary goal of finding a Pikachu is currently unknown.

**Recent Actions:**

*   Repeatedly engaged in battles with wild Pidgey.
*   Initially defaulted to using the first available move in battles.
*   Began strategically selecting moves like "Tackle" (and "Scratch") once move information became available.
*   "MAN" has taken damage during battles, requiring careful move selection to ensure survival and victory.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Wild Pidgey are a common encounter early in the game.
*   The player's Pokémon has access to moves such as "Tackle," "Sand-Attack", and "Scratch."
*   Battles can be won using offensive moves like "Tackle" and "Scratch".
*   The player is learning to adapt their strategy based on the opponent and their Pokémon's health.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Continue exploring new areas** to increase the chance of encountering a Pikachu.
2.  **Gather more information about available moves** to make more informed decisions during battles.
3.  **Monitor "MAN"'s HP** during battles and consider using healing items if necessary (if available).
4.  **Consider catching other Pokémon** to diversify the team and improve battle capabilities.
5.  **Look for clues or areas known to be Pikachu habitats.**

**Challenges and Insights:**

*   **Limited Information:** Initially, the player lacked information about available moves, hindering strategic decision-making. This was overcome by learning move names after several turns.
*   **Repetitive Encounters:** The frequent encounters with Pidgey, while providing experience, might be slowing progress towards the primary goal of finding a Pikachu. A change in location is needed.
*   **HP Management:** "MAN" taking damage during battles highlights the importance of managing health and strategically using moves to minimize damage taken.

**Conclusion:**

Progress is being made in understanding the battle mechanics and available moves. However, focus should shift towards exploring diverse areas to increase the likelihood of encountering a Pikachu and diversifying the team. Further strategic move selection and HP management will be crucial for success.
