# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles

## Current Status

We are currently traversing Route 1, actively seeking wild Pokémon encounters within the tall grass. Our primary Pokémon (Pidgey) has gained experience through recent battles and is likely growing stronger. We are consistently initiating battles.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 10-14:** Navigated Route 1, primarily focusing on exploring the tall grass to initiate wild Pokémon encounters. Successfully won at least one battle, as evidenced by experience gained.
*   **Turns 15-19:** Engaged in a series of battles against wild Pidgey. Consistently selected the first attack option in these battles.

## Key Discoveries

*   Route 1 is populated with Pidgey, which are frequent encounters.
*   Walking through the tall grass effectively triggers wild Pokémon battles.
*   The first attack option appears to be consistently selected during battles.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Exploring Route 1:** Persist in exploring Route 1 to encounter and battle more wild Pokémon. This will further level up our Pokémon and potentially lead to the discovery of new species.
2.  **Refine Battle Strategy:** While consistently using the first attack option works, consider exploring different attack options within the battles to optimize damage output and potentially conserve PP (move points). Experiment with different attacks to see what is more effective in different situations.
3.  **Monitor Pokémon Level:** Pay attention to the level of our Pokémon and determine when it might be appropriate to proceed to the next route or area. Avoid over-leveling early on, but also ensure sufficient strength for upcoming challenges.
4.  **Potentially Capture New Pokemon:** Now that the team is winning battles, and if the current team member is improving, consider capturing a new team member to expand the Pokemon collection.
