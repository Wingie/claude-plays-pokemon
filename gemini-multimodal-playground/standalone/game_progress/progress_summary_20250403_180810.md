# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently engaged in wild Pokémon battles, location within the game world is not explicitly known based on these turns. Possibly Viridian Forest.
*   **Objective:** Primarily focused on leveling up our Pokémon through battling. A secondary, longer-term objective is to find and, presumably, capture a Pikachu.
*   **Pokémon Team:**
    *   Pidgey (Level 12, 31/33 HP) - Known as of Turn 47.

## Recent Actions

*   Repeatedly engaged in wild Pokémon battles, primarily against Caterpie.
*   Utilized a default "attack" action (pressing 'A') at the start of battles when information was lacking.
*   Moved within tall grass to trigger wild Pokémon encounters.
*   Encountered and initiated a battle with a Pikachu.
*   As of turn 47, chose to use Tackle during a battle with a Caterpie.

## Key Discoveries and Insights

*   **High Caterpie Encounter Rate:** The area we are currently in seems to have a high encounter rate for Caterpie.
*   **Pikachu Encountered:** The long-term objective of finding a Pikachu has been achieved (at least in terms of encountering one).
*   **Pidgey's Health:** As of Turn 47, Pidgey is level 12 with 31/33 HP.
*   **Known Move: Tackle:** Pidgey has access to the move Tackle, and we should prioritize using it.

## Challenges and Obstacles

*   **Limited Information:** Initial turns were made without knowledge of Pokémon health or move sets, requiring default actions.
*   **Repetitive Encounters:** The frequent Caterpie encounters may slow down the leveling process if they provide minimal experience.
*   **Survival and Efficiency:** Lack of HP information in initial turns made it difficult to strategize effectively and ensure the Pokémon's survival.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Prioritize Effective Moves:** Now that we know Pidgey has Tackle, we should prioritize using it to defeat opponents more efficiently.
2.  **Monitor HP:** Actively monitor Pidgey's HP during battles to avoid fainting. Consider using healing items if necessary (if available).
3.  **Evaluate Pikachu:** Determine the best strategy for either capturing or defeating the encountered Pikachu.
4.  **Optimize Leveling Location:** If Caterpie provides insufficient experience, explore other areas to find Pokémon that yield more significant level gains.
5.  **Explore and Progress:** Move beyond the current area (likely Viridian Forest) to access new locations and challenges.
