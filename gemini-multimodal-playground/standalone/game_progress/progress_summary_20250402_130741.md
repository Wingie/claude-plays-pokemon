# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen - Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Unknown - exploring the starting area. Currently in tall grass.
*   **Progress:** Have successfully entered the tall grass but have not encountered any Pokémon battles yet.
*   **Challenges:** Getting stuck in a possible loop while exploring the tall grass.
*   **Team:** (Initial state assumed, no Pokémon caught or party details are available yet).

## Recent Actions (Turns 0-16)

*   **Turns 0-1:** Moved from the initial starting position towards the tall grass to initiate wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Turn 2-4:** Entered the tall grass and began moving randomly (Down, Down, Right) to trigger a wild Pokémon battle.
*   **Turns 12-15:** Continuously exploring tall grass by moving "Up".
*   **Turn 16:** Recognizing a possible loop and changing direction to "Right" in an attempt to break free.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Initial Location:** The starting point has a visible path and tall grass to the south.
*   **Tall Grass Mechanics:** Moving through tall grass increases the chance of encountering wild Pokémon.
*   **Potential Obstacles:** Possible looping behavior during exploration. Requires varied movements to avoid getting stuck.

## Strategies & Insights

*   **Movement Strategy:** Initial plan was to move into tall grass and then move randomly to trigger battles.
*   **Looping Issue:** The continued "Up" movement (turns 12-15) led to a potential loop. This suggests the need for more diverse exploration patterns.
*   **Adaptive Approach:** The decision to switch direction to "Right" (turn 16) demonstrates an adaptive approach to address the potential looping issue.
*   **Healing Assumptions:** The strategy assumes that we can heal when required, potentially with potions, but there's been no need yet.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Break the Loop:** Continue exploring the tall grass, using a combination of up, down, left, and right movements to avoid getting stuck in any one area.
2.  **Trigger a Battle:** The primary objective remains to encounter a wild Pokémon and engage in a battle.
3.  **Gather More Information:** As battles occur, update this document with information on the team, encountered Pokémon, and any required healing needs.
4.  **Explore Beyond the Grass:** Once a few battles have been fought, consider leaving the initial grassy area to explore other parts of the starting location to potentially find the designated PokeCenter.
5.  **Determine Current Coordinates:** If possible, determine the current coordinates using game menus (if accessible) to better track location.
