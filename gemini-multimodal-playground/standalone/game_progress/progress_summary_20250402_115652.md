# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Locate and capture a Pikachu.

## Current Status

The player character is currently stuck on a rock formation surrounded by grass and other rocks. Progress is significantly hampered by this location, which restricts movement and prevents exploration of the surrounding areas. The player is actively trying to find a way off the rock formation.

## Recent Actions (Turns 10-19)

The primary focus of the last ten turns has been attempting to escape the rock formation.  The player has repeatedly found themselves in similar locations, indicating a cyclical pattern in their movements. Initial attempts to break the loop involved changing directions randomly (Left, Down, Up, Right). However, these proved unsuccessful. A more focused approach of consistently moving south has been attempted, but also hasn't yielded results. Finally, moving left is the current strategy.

Specific actions taken:

*   **Turns 10-12:** Experiencing a loop. Attempts to break the loop by changing direction randomly were ineffective.
*   **Turn 13:** Analysis identified the loop. The player attempted to move right to break out.
*   **Turn 14:** South direction was attempted.
*   **Turns 15-19:** Consistent attempts to move south and then left in order to escape the rock formation.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Limited Mobility:** The player's movement is heavily restricted by the rock formation.
*   **Looping Behavior:**  Certain movement patterns (especially Left, Down, Up) consistently return the player to the same location, indicating a closed loop within the game's environment.
*   **Environmental Obstacles:** The rock formations, fences, and grassy areas are acting as barriers, preventing free exploration.
*   **Southeast Bush:** On turn 17, a bush was noted to be in the southeast, which could possibly be a clue.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Navigation:** The player is struggling to navigate the environment and is consistently finding themselves stuck in loops.
*   **Obstacle Avoidance:** The rock formation is the primary obstacle, preventing access to potentially richer areas where Pikachu might be found.
*   **Lack of Progress:** Despite numerous attempts to move, the player has made little to no progress towards the primary goal.

## Strategies Evaluated

*   **Random Direction Changes:** Initially, the player attempted to break the loop by randomly changing directions. This proved ineffective.
*   **Consistent Direction (South):** A more focused approach of consistently moving south was attempted, but also failed.
*   **Consistent Direction (Left):** Current strategy to get off the rock formation.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Escape the Rock Formation:** The immediate priority is to find a way off the rock formation. Continuing to attempt moving left is the current strategy. If this does not work, reconsidering the surrounding environment (including the bush in the southeast) is necessary.
2.  **Map the Area:** Once free from the rock formation, the player should attempt to create a mental map of the area to avoid getting stuck in loops again.
3.  **Resume Pikachu Search:** After navigating out of the current area, the player should resume the search for Pikachu, focusing on areas with grassy patches. Consider searching the bush identified.
