# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turn 35 - Turn 44

## Current Status

Currently trapped inside the Poké Mart. We have purchased a potion. The immediate goal of escaping the shop remains unfulfilled.

## Recent Actions

The primary action taken over the past ten turns has been attempting to exit the Poké Mart. The following directional movements have been attempted, all unsuccessfully:

*   Right (multiple attempts)
*   Left
*   Down (multiple attempts)
*   Up

A potion was purchased at some point before this reporting period began.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Stuck in the Shop:** The player has identified a bug or UI/control issue preventing them from exiting the Poké Mart. Repeated attempts to leave using various directions have failed.
*   **Potion Purchased:** A potion was acquired. This suggests the availability of healing items for future use.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Navigational Issue:** Inability to exit the Poké Mart, preventing exploration and Pokémon catching. This suggests a misunderstanding of the game's controls or a potential glitch.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Escape the Poké Mart:** The priority is to successfully exit the Poké Mart. The player has identified that moving down might be the right way to exit the shop.
2.  **Explore the Area:** Once free from the Poké Mart, resume the original goal of exploring the surrounding area to discover new locations, characters, and Pokémon.
3.  **Catch Pokémon:** Begin attempting to catch wild Pokémon to build a team.

## Notes

The repetitive nature of the logs indicates a persistent issue with exiting the Poké Mart. Further analysis of the game mechanics or exploration of alternative solutions is needed to proceed effectively. Considering that multiple attempts were made with various directions, potentially other keys should be tested (e.g., "B" key).
