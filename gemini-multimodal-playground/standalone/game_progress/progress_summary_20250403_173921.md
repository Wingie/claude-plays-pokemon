# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Expedition

**Current Status:**

*   Location: Viridian Forest
*   Objective: Capture a Pikachu
*   In tall grass, encountering wild Pokémon.
*   Lead Pokémon HP: Full (24/24)
*   Engaged in a series of battles (currently battling Kakuna).

**Recent Actions (Turns 0-28):**

*   **Initial Exploration (Turns 0-4):** Initial assessment of Viridian Forest.  The objective was set to find Pikachu and level up Pokemon by walking into tall grass to initiate battle. Initial turns were spent navigating towards tall grass located to the west (left).
*   **Entry into Tall Grass (Turn 5):** Successfully navigated to tall grass and activated the ability to encounter wild Pokémon.
*   **Repeated Encounters with Kakuna (Turns 25-28):** Engaged in a series of battles with Kakuna. The battles are approached with a standard "Fight -> First Move" strategy.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Location of tall grass within Viridian Forest.
*   Confirmed the presence of Kakuna in Viridian Forest.
*   The current battle strategy of using the first attack works for Kakuna (though efficiency isn't confirmed).

**Challenges Faced:**

*   The main challenge is the repetition of Kakuna encounters. While leveling is a secondary objective, progress towards the primary objective (capturing Pikachu) is stalled.
*   The "Fight -> First Move" strategy is working but may not be optimal for all encounters.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Continue Exploring Tall Grass:** Persist in moving through the tall grass in Viridian Forest to increase the chances of encountering a Pikachu.
2.  **Evaluate Battle Strategy:** While the current strategy is effective, begin to observe the type of attacks used and consider if there may be a more efficient choice as the game progresses. Consider capturing a Pokemon rather than fighting it.
3.  **Resource Management:** Monitor items and Pokeball count (currently unknown). Once known, make sure to keep enough Pokeballs to allow for Pikachu capture.

**Longer Term Strategy Adjustments:**

*   If Pikachu encounters remain elusive after a reasonable amount of time, consider researching its spawn rate and locations within Viridian Forest to optimize the search.
*   As the team levels up and more move options become available, consider branching off into areas other than tall grass to vary the possible encounters.
