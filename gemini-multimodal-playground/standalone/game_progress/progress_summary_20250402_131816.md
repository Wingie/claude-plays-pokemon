# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** Current Date
**Objective:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

*   Currently engaged in a battle with a wild Pidgey (Turn 99).
*   Lead Pokémon has 12/21 HP.
*   Decision has been made to attack with the first available move.
*   Prioritizing healing at the Pokémon Center due to low HP, but inadvertently entered another battle (Turns 93-98).

## Recent Actions (Turns 90-99)

*   **Initial Success:** Successfully defeated a wild Pidgey, earning 15 EXP for our lead Pokémon (Turns 90-92).
*   **Healing Required:** Recognizing that the lead Pokémon's HP (12/21) has fallen below 30%, we made the decision to head back to a Pokémon Center for healing (Turns 93-98). This decision was made after initially deciding against healing (Turn 92).
*   **Navigation Challenges:** Encountered difficulty with navigating to the Pokémon Center, particularly regarding exiting the tall grass and determining the correct direction to Viridian City. Initially moved up (Turn 93) then made attempts to exit the grass by moving down (Turns 94, 96, 97).
*   **Unexpected Encounter:** While attempting to leave the tall grass, unintentionally entered another battle with a wild Pidgey (Turn 99).

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **HP Threshold:** Established a critical HP threshold (30% of max HP) to trigger a retreat for healing.
*   **Location of Pokémon Center:** Recalling that the Pokémon Center is located in Viridian City (Turn 95).
*   **Unpredictable Encounters:** Confirmed that wild Pokémon encounters can occur at any time, even when attempting to retreat for healing.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Win Current Battle:** Successfully defeat the wild Pidgey in the current battle (Turn 99).
2.  **Prioritize Healing:** Immediately after the battle, resume the journey to the Viridian City Pokémon Center to fully heal the lead Pokémon.
3.  **Improve Navigation:** Refine navigation skills to more efficiently reach the Pokémon Center, potentially by using landmarks or referring to in-game maps.
4.  **Avoid Tall Grass:** Strategize to minimize time spent in tall grass to reduce the likelihood of unexpected encounters when HP is low.
5.  **Re-evaluate Healing Threshold:** Consider adjusting the healing threshold based on the frequency of wild encounters and the difficulty of reaching the Pokémon Center.

## Strategies & Outcomes

*   **Attack First Strategy:** The initial strategy of attacking first in battles appears successful. However, it's important to consider alternative strategies as we progress and encounter stronger Pokémon.
*   **Healing Delay Issue:** The delayed decision to heal and the subsequent difficulty navigating to the Pokémon Center resulted in another unintended battle. This highlights the importance of proactive resource management.
