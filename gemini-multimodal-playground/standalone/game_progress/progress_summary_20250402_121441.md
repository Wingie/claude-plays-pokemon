# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on assumed context)

## Current Status

*   **Primary Goal:** Train Mankey to level up.
*   **Active Pokémon:** Charmander (26/29 HP). Mankey has fainted.
*   **Location:** Unknown Route (battling wild Pidgey).

## Recent Actions (Turns 15-24)

Our recent efforts have been focused on training Mankey through battles with wild Pidgey. The strategy was to utilize Mankey's "Scratch" attack to gain experience. However, Mankey's low HP proved to be a significant obstacle.

*   **Turns 15-18:** Fought multiple Pidgey using Mankey's Scratch. Mankey's HP dwindled from 10/15 to 5/15.
*   **Turn 19:** Mankey's HP was critically low (5/15), requiring a strategic switch.
*   **Turn 20:** Mankey fainted and was switched to Charmander.
*   **Turns 21-22:** Charmander was deployed to continue the battle against Pidgey, using its "Scratch" attack.
*   **Turn 23:** Charmander successfully defeated the Pidgey.
*   **Turn 24:** Mankey gained 11 EXP. Points!

## Key Discoveries and Insights

*   **Mankey's Vulnerability:** Mankey's low HP makes it difficult to sustain consecutive battles without healing items or switching. Relying solely on Mankey's "Scratch" attack is proving insufficient.
*   **Charmander's Utility:** Charmander provides a reliable backup option when Mankey is at risk.
*   **Pidgey Prevalence:** Pidgey appears to be a common encounter in the current area, providing a consistent source of experience.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Revive/Heal Mankey:** Prioritize reviving or healing Mankey at the nearest Pokémon Center.
2.  **Re-strategize Mankey Training:** Implement a more strategic approach to training Mankey:
    *   Consider using healing items (Potions) to keep Mankey in battle longer.
    *   Explore alternative routes with potentially weaker Pokémon for easier experience gains.
    *   Use Charmander to weaken opponents before switching in Mankey for the finishing blow.
3.  **Explore for Potions:** Investigate if the current area has any pick-up items for healing, especially Potions.
4.  **Evaluate Mankey's Moveset:** Once Mankey levels up, assess its new moves and determine if they offer more effective strategies.
