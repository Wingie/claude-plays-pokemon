# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Expedition

**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and find a Pikachu to catch.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest
*   **Activity:** Battling Pokémon to level up while searching for Pikachu.
*   **Coords:** (11, 4)
*   **State:** Just cleared battle summary screen

## Recent Actions (Turns 10-19)

We have been actively exploring Viridian Forest, focusing on battling wild Pokémon to gain experience. Recent turns were dominated by an encounter with a Weedle. Initially, we engaged in combat using "Tackle" and "Scratch". After defeating the Weedle, multiple turns were spent clearing the battle summary screen.

**Summary of Actions:**

*   **Turns 10-12:** Engaged in battle with a Weedle. Used "Tackle" and "Scratch".
*   **Turns 13-19:** Cleared the battle summary screen after defeating the Weedle. Continuously pressing the 'A' button.

## Key Discoveries

*   Confirmed presence of Weedle in Viridian Forest.
*   Movement from coords (4,4) to (11,4) suggest we have moved further into the forest.
*   The process of clearing the battle summary requires multiple 'A' button presses.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Pikachu Encounter:** Have yet to encounter a Pikachu. The search continues.
*   **Repetitive Actions:** Clearing the battle summary screen has become a time-consuming process.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Exploration:**  Resume exploration of Viridian Forest with the primary goal of encountering a Pikachu.
2.  **Optimize Battle Summary Clearing:**  Potentially look for a faster method or automation to clear the battle summary screen.
3.  **Consider Alternate Strategies:** If Pikachu remains elusive, re-evaluate exploration patterns or consider using repels to avoid weaker Pokémon and increase Pikachu encounter rate (if higher level Pokemon have a greater chance of spawning pikachu).
