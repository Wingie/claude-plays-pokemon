# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on the "recent" in prompt)

## Current Status

*   **Primary Goal:** Level up Mankey.
*   **Party Condition:** Mankey is currently weak and often faints early in battles. Charmander is the primary battler, at 26/29 HP.
*   **Location:** Unknown, but in tall grass, suitable for finding wild Pokémon battles.

## Recent Actions (Turns 20-29)

*   Engaged in multiple battles against Pidgey in the tall grass.
*   Utilized Charmander's "Scratch" attack to defeat Pidgey.
*   Mankey briefly participated in battles, but consistently fainted/had very low HP.
*   Explored a small area with tall grass, trees, and a path leading north, prioritizing staying in the tall grass for encounters.

## Key Discoveries & Observations

*   **Pidgey is a common encounter in the tall grass.** This is helpful for finding consistent experience, but may be slowing progress due to low experience yield.
*   **Mankey is too weak to effectively battle at the current level.**  It requires significant protection and possibly a dedicated healing strategy.
*   **Charmander is a reliable battler, but potentially over-leveled compared to Mankey.** This creates a challenge in splitting experience.
*   **Current location has limited exploration options.**  Only a small patch of tall grass is accessible.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Balancing Mankey's training with survival.** Mankey's low HP makes it difficult to contribute to battles without fainting.
*   **Uneven Experience Distribution.** Charmander is absorbing most of the experience points, potentially hindering Mankey's progress.

## Strategies & Results

*   **Using Charmander to weaken opponents before switching to Mankey (Unsuccessful).** Mankey consistently fainted before gaining significant experience.
*   **Repeatedly battling Pidgey (Partially Successful).** Provided a consistent source of experience, but the rate of progress for Mankey is slow.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Develop a Safer Training Strategy for Mankey:**
    *   Consider using Potions to heal Mankey during battles.
    *   Prioritize finding weaker opponents if available (potentially by exploring different areas).
    *   Explore if other Pokemon attacks will give Mankey a type advantage over the found Pidgey
2.  **Explore the Surrounding Area:**
    *   Head north along the path to potentially discover new areas with different Pokémon encounters.
    *   Investigate the ledge to the left, although the utility is unknown at this time.
3.  **Consider Alternative Leveling Options:**
    *   If Mankey's progress remains slow, explore if there is a Pokemon Center nearby for healing and recovery between fights.
    *   Consider using items to boost Mankey's stats, if available.
