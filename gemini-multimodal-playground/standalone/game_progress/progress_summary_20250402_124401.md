# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

The player is currently engaged in a protracted battle with a wild Pidgey. The player's Pidgey is taking damage and currently has 5/17 HP remaining. The wild Pidgey also has taken damage. The player is consistently choosing the 'Fight' option and then selecting 'Tackle'.

## Recent Actions (Turns 80-89)

*   **Consistent Battle Engagement:** The last ten turns have been solely focused on a single battle against a wild Pidgey.
*   **Tackle Spam:** The player is primarily using the 'Tackle' move repeatedly.
*   **Health Monitoring:** The player is tracking the health of their own Pokémon (Pidgey) and appears to be paying attention to the wild Pidgey's health as well.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Battle Mechanics:** The player is actively learning the basic battle interface and action selection process.
*   **Damage Exchange:** The player has observed that using 'Tackle' deals damage to the opponent, but also results in damage taken.
*   **Resource Management:** The player's Pidgey is taking damage, highlighting the importance of managing health and potentially using items or alternative strategies in the future.
*   **The importance of keeping track of the enemy pokemon's HP** The player has been keeping track of the enemy's HP, and this allows them to make informed decisions about when to strike and when to heal.

## Next Objectives

*   **Complete the Current Battle:** Focus on winning the ongoing battle with the wild Pidgey. This might involve continuing to use 'Tackle', but consider if other options may become available later, especially if the Pidgey's health becomes critically low.
*   **Consider Healing:** If the battle continues to be prolonged, consider the use of potions (if available) or retreating to a Pokémon Center to heal.
*   **Explore Move Variety (Future):** Once comfortable with the battle interface, begin to learn about different move types and their effectiveness.
*   **Consider Strategy:** Start considering that the best method to beat Pokemon may not be simply using Tackle over and over again, but instead, there may be a best choice to make during certain instances.

## Insights and Challenges

*   **Repetitive Gameplay:** The consistent use of 'Tackle' suggests a lack of awareness of other available moves or a lack of confidence in using them.
*   **Vulnerability:** The decreasing health of the player's Pidgey indicates a need to develop more strategic approaches to battles.
*   **Learning Curve:** The player is actively engaged in learning the game's mechanics, but needs to expand their knowledge of available options and strategic considerations.
*   **Opportunity:** The player is engaging in a battle that will allow them to gain levels and XP for their Pokemon.
