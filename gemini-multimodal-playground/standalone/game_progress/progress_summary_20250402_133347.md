# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore the world and encounter a Pikachu.

**Current Status:**

*   Exploring the overworld, engaging in battles primarily with Pidgey and Rattata.
*   Lead Pokémon: Pidgey (Level 8, 14/25 HP).
*   Not currently in battle. Not currently needing healing.

**Recent Actions (Turns 20-29):**

The primary activity over the last ten turns has been battling wild Pokémon, primarily Pidgey and Rattata. The battles were initiated while navigating the overworld and attempting to move through tall grass in pursuit of encounters and Pikachu. Pidgey's level has increased, demonstrating progress in leveling up our Pokemon. After each battle, the system assessed if the game was still in a battle state and the health of our active Pokemon. We are now in tall grass after trying to make progress.

*   **Turns 20-23:** Battled and defeated multiple wild Pidgey.
*   **Turns 24-25:** Successfully navigated to tall grass, initiating a battle with a Rattata.
*   **Turns 26-29:** Engaged in an ongoing battle with a Rattata, primarily using the move "Tackle". Pidgey sustained some damage during these turns.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   **Enemy Composition:** Encounters in the current area primarily consist of Pidgey and Rattata.
*   **Battle Mechanics:** The "Tackle" move is effective against Rattata at this stage.
*   **HP Management:** Monitoring Pidgey's HP is critical to ensure it doesn't faint.

**Obstacles Faced:**

*   **Low HP:** Pidgey has taken damage during battles, but has never dropped below 30% of its maximum hp.
*   **Lack of Pikachu Encounter:** Despite consistent exploration of the overworld, a Pikachu has yet to be encountered.
*   **Navigational Challenges:** The AI struggles to maintain awareness of its location relative to tall grass.

**Strategies Employed:**

*   **Early Game Focus:** Focus is on leveling up the initial Pokémon (Pidgey) through frequent battles.
*   **Tackle Spam:** Relying on "Tackle" as the primary attack move in early battles.
*   **Tall Grass Pursuit:** Prioritizing movement to and through tall grass to maximize Pokémon encounter rates.
*   **HP Monitoring:** Keeping an eye on Pidgey's HP to determine if healing is necessary.

**Next Objectives:**

*   **Continue Exploring Tall Grass:** Persistently explore the tall grass to increase the likelihood of encountering new Pokémon.
*   **Encounter Pikachu:** Continue searching for Pikachu.
*   **Defeat Rattata:** Finish the ongoing battle with the Rattata.
*   **Level Up Pidgey:** Gain more experience through battles to increase Pidgey's level and stats.
*   **Monitor HP:** Continue to monitor Pidgey's HP to avoid fainting.
*   **Possibly Learn New Moves:** Leveling up Pidgey will open up opportunities for it to learn new moves.
