# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Approaching Viridian City (exited tall grass in Viridian Forest).
*   **Party Status:** Lead Pokémon (Pidgey) at 24/29 HP. **Needs Healing!**
*   **Overall Progress:** Still within Viridian Forest, haven't found Pikachu. Current focus shifted to healing Pidgey.

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 25-34)

*   **Turns 25-27:** Engaged in multiple battles with a Caterpie. Successfully defeated it, but sustained some damage to Pidgey. Repeatedly attacking in battle.
*   **Turns 28-29:** Cleared the battle summary screen after defeating the Caterpie, progressing past each summary page with the 'A' button.
*   **Turns 30-34:** Exited the battle and am now navigating out of Viridian Forest due to Pidgey's low HP. Consistently moving downwards, towards Viridian City and its Pokémon Center, pressing the 'Down' button. The state checker is now correctly identifying when healing is needed.

## III. Key Discoveries

*   **Caterpie Encounters:** Viridian Forest has a high encounter rate with Caterpie, which is delaying Pikachu hunt.
*   **HP Management:** The initial strategy of aggressive exploration has been curtailed due to HP depletion.  Healing is now a priority.
*   **Navigation:** Successfully navigated out of the tall grass and onto the path leading towards Viridian City.

## IV. Obstacles Faced

*   **Low HP:** Pidgey's low HP is preventing further exploration of Viridian Forest for Pikachu.
*   **Caterpie Encounters:** Frequent battles with Caterpie are consuming resources (HP) and time.

## V. Strategies & Insights

*   **Failed Strategy:** Continued exploration without considering healing resources was unsustainable.
*   **Revised Strategy:** Prioritizing healing is now crucial to efficient exploration and achieving the primary goal.
*   **Learning:**  The need to balance exploration with HP management is vital in the early game.

## VI. Next Objectives

1.  **Reach Viridian City:** Continue moving downwards to reach Viridian City.
2.  **Heal Pidgey:** Fully heal Pidgey at the Pokémon Center in Viridian City.
3.  **Return to Viridian Forest:** Return to Viridian Forest to resume the search for Pikachu.
4.  **Optimize Route:** Consider optimizing the route within Viridian Forest to minimize unnecessary encounters while maximizing the chance of finding Pikachu.  Perhaps focusing on areas near yellow flowers, based on common Pikachu habitat patterns.
