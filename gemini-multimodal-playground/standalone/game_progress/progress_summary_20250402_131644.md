# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently engaged in a wild Pidgey battle in the overworld.
*   **Lead Pokémon HP:** 12/21 HP (Low - Requires Healing)
*   **Flag:** `needs_healing = True` (Set internally)

## Recent Actions & Summary (Turns 90-99)

The primary activity has been encountering wild Pokémon, specifically Pidgey, and attempting to engage in battles. Several battles have been won, resulting in experience points gained for the lead Pokémon. However, the lead Pokémon has sustained damage, bringing its HP dangerously low (12/21). After misinterpreting the HP situation initially, the low HP has now been correctly recognized and the focus has shifted to healing at the Pokémon Center. The immediate action is to win the current battle.

The player is currently lost and keeps circling around the starting area, running in to the same battle over and over again.

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Low HP Threshold:** The decision-making process has been refined to prioritize healing when the lead Pokémon's HP falls below 30% of its maximum.
*   **Navigational Challenges:** The player is currently unsure of the Pokémon Center's location and needs better map awareness. The assumption that the Pokémon Center is to the left may be incorrect.
*   **Battle Engagement:** A battle plan is in place; select FIGHT and the first move available.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Win Current Battle:** Defeat the wild Pidgey in the current battle.
2.  **Heal Lead Pokémon:** Immediately after the current battle, navigate to the nearest Pokémon Center to fully restore the lead Pokémon's HP. The identified location is Viridian City.
3.  **Improve Navigation:** Before resuming the primary goal of finding and winning battles, a better understanding of the map and the location of essential facilities like the Pokémon Center is needed.

## Challenges & Mitigation

*   **Low HP:** The lead Pokémon is in danger of fainting, which could lead to setbacks. This will be mitigated by prioritizing healing.
*   **Navigation:** Misunderstanding the location of Viridian City and the Pokemon center is a major hurdle.
*   **Repetitive Battles:** The player is stuck fighting the same Pokemon over and over again.
