# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore the current area (implied Route 3/4/similar early route) and catch a Mankey, Pikachu, and Pidgey.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Exploring an early route (likely Route 3, 4, or a similar area with Mankey spawns).
*   **Party:** Currently consists of Charmander (implied, given Leer debuff and repeated Mankey encounters).
*   **Inventory:** Has Poké Balls available for catching Pokémon.
*   **Progress:** Actively attempting to catch a Mankey. Success remains elusive.

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 15-24)

The primary focus has been on attempting to capture a Mankey. Recent actions consist almost entirely of the following loop:

1.  Engage in battle with a Mankey.
2.  Throw a Poké Ball.
3.  Await the outcome of the capture attempt (requiring user input).
4.  If unsuccessful, re-enter the item menu, select a Poké Ball, and use it again.

This loop has been repeated numerous times, indicating a persistent difficulty in catching the Mankey.

## III. Key Discoveries and Challenges

*   **Mankey Encounters:** Mankey are present and battle-able. The game world allows us to encounter it.
*   **Leer Spam:** Mankey is frequently using Leer, which lowers Charmander's defense. This doesn't seem to be severely impacting the capture process, but it could become a factor in prolonged battles.
*   **Catch Rate Difficulty:** The Mankey is proving difficult to catch. Either the catch rate is low, or we are simply experiencing bad luck.
*   **User Interface Repetition:** The process of selecting and using Poké Balls appears to be somewhat repetitive, as the menu selections need to be re-made each turn.

## IV. Next Objectives

*   **Capture Mankey:** Continue persistent attempts to capture a Mankey. Consider lowering Mankey's health before throwing Poké Balls to increase capture odds. Evaluate if status conditions (sleep, paralysis) are possible and beneficial at this early stage of the game.
*   **Locate and Capture Pikachu:** Once Mankey is secured (or if the Mankey hunt becomes too resource-intensive), shift focus to finding and capturing a Pikachu. Research its spawn location in this version of the game (Viridian Forest?).
*   **Catch Pidgey:** Pidgey are generally common early-game Pokémon. Catching one should be prioritized soon, especially if the Pikachu search proves difficult.
*   **Optimize Battle Strategy:** Experiment with different strategies to weaken Pokémon before attempting to catch them, improving capture odds.
*   **Resource Management:** Monitor Poké Ball usage and ensure sufficient supplies are available for continued capture attempts. Consider visiting a Poké Mart to restock if necessary.
