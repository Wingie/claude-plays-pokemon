Result: Button sequence Right executed

Gemini: Okay, I see the sign says "PALLET TOWN". I am in Pallet Town. My objective is to reach Viridian City, which is north of Pallet Town. I need to head north out of town. There's a fence blocking the path directly north, so I need to find an opening to the north.

I will move right, then up, then left.
