# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on "recent" game turns)

**Current Goal:** Train Mankey by engaging in wild Pokémon battles.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Route 1 (Outside Viridian City Pokémon Center)
*   **Objective:** Actively seeking wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Pokémon Center Visits:** We've spent considerable time healing at the Viridian City Pokémon Center.

## II. Recent Actions (Summarized)

*   **Repeated Pokémon Center Trips:** Multiple turns were spent entering and exiting the Viridian City Pokémon Center. This suggests either frequent battles requiring healing or accidental entry.
*   **Route 1 Exploration:** We are currently navigating Route 1, specifically moving *up* the path to find encounters.
*   **Wild Pokémon Encounter:** Successfully initiated a battle with a wild Rattata.
*   **Battle Strategy:** Used the first attack option in battle.
*   **Initial Strategy:** First actions were to find grass and walk upward in hopes of finding an encounter.

## III. Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Route 1 is the Training Ground:** We are using Route 1 as the primary area to find wild Pokémon battles to level up Mankey.
*   **Pokémon Center Reliance:** The frequent trips to the Pokémon Center indicate that Mankey may be struggling with early-game battles or that we are prioritizing healing after each encounter to maximize training efficiency.
*   **Rattata Encounters:** Rattata are present and being encountered on Route 1.
*   **Game Mechanics:** Gained experience in navigating menus and initiating battles.

## IV. Next Objectives

1.  **Maximize Wild Encounters:** Continue exploring Route 1, focusing on areas with tall grass, to trigger frequent battles.
2.  **Monitor Mankey's Health:** Carefully observe Mankey's HP during battles and return to the Pokémon Center as needed. Consider using Potions if available to extend training sessions without repeated Center visits.
3.  **Develop Battle Strategy:** Evaluate the effectiveness of the "first attack" strategy against different Pokémon types. Experiment with different attacks as Mankey levels up and learns new moves.
4.  **Explore Route 1 Further:** Continue moving up along Route 1 to find new battle opportunities.
