# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** Current Date

**Overall Goal:** Level up Pokémon

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, standing in tall grass. Exact location coordinates are (7, 5).
*   **Lead Pokémon HP:** Full (19/19) - No healing needed.
*   **Battle Status:** Currently *not* in battle.

## II. Recent Actions and Analysis

The gameplay has alternated between two states: battling and exploring.

*   **Turns 0-4:** Repeatedly entered battles with wild Rattata. During each battle, the chosen action was to select the first move ('A') without knowledge of its type or effectiveness. This was a placeholder action due to lack of information on available moves.
*   **Turns 20-24:** Broke out of the battle loop and found ourselves in the overworld, standing in tall grass at coordinates (7, 5). The system initially struggled to update the coordinates, resulting in repeated attempts to move left and then right, without success. This issue has been noted and attempts are being made to fix it.
*   **Action Focus:** Currently prioritizing triggering random encounters in the tall grass to level up the Pokémon.

## III. Key Discoveries and Challenges

*   **Common Enemy:** Rattata appears to be a common encounter in the current area.
*   **Action Selection Blindness:** Lacking information on available movesets makes strategic battle decisions impossible. Defaulting to the first move.
*   **Coordinate Update Issue:** Encountered a problem where the coordinate updates were failing, leading to repeated, ineffective movement attempts. This is preventing exploration.
*   **Zero Damage taken:** So far, damage taken has been zero.

## IV. Next Objectives

1.  **Trigger Battles:** Continue moving within the tall grass patch at coordinates (7,5) to initiate battles.
2.  **Gather Move Information:** Once a battle is initiated, prioritize learning the available moves and their types for strategic advantage. This is essential for effective leveling.
3.  **Monitor Coordinate Update:** Closely monitor whether the coordinate update issue is resolved. If not, further investigation and potential debugging are necessary.
4.  **Evaluate Leveling Efficiency:** If the Rattata encounters prove insufficient for leveling, consider exploring other areas for potentially higher-level Pokémon (once navigation is possible).
5. **Optimize Battle Strategy:** Once movesets are known, develop a more strategic approach to battles, considering type matchups and move effectiveness.
