# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

**Current Status:**

*   Location: Viridian Forest (overworld, after a battle)
*   Lead Pokémon HP: 22/29 (Needs Healing)
*   Objective: Returning to Viridian City Pokémon Center for healing.

**Recent Actions (Turns 35-44):**

*   **Initial Exploration & Low HP:** Began on a path in Viridian Forest, but with low HP. Initial plan was to head south back to Viridian City's Pokémon Center for healing. However, movement got stuck in a loop.
*   **Directional Change:** Attempted to move left instead of down to avoid the movement loop.
*   **Encountered Wild Pokémon:** Moving left led to an unexpected encounter with a Caterpie.
*   **Repeated Battles:** Engaged in multiple battles with Caterpie (and one with Pidgey). The selected strategy was to use the first move (Tackle), leading to consecutive turns of battling.
*   **Battle Summary:** Won the battle against the Caterpie, but is still at low health. Currently clearing the battle summary.

**Key Discoveries & Challenges:**

*   **Movement Loops:** Encountered a problem getting stuck in a loop when moving down in the Viridian Forest, likely due to the path structure. This highlights the need for smarter pathfinding.
*   **Unintended Battles:** Attempting to avoid the movement loop led to immediate battle encounters, further depleting the lead Pokémon's HP.
*   **No Pikachu Sightings:** Despite the goal to find Pikachu, no Pikachu encounters have occurred. Encounters are still mainly Caterpies and Pidgeys.
*   **Healing Priority:** Lead Pokémon's HP is consistently low, making healing a crucial priority over exploration and Pikachu hunting.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Complete Battle Summary:** Finish clearing the battle summary to return to the overworld.
2.  **Prioritize Healing:** Head directly to the Viridian City Pokémon Center to fully heal the lead Pokémon. Pathfinding needs to be improved to avoid getting stuck and minimize further wild encounters.
3.  **Return to Viridian Forest:** Once healed, return to Viridian Forest to resume exploration for Pikachu.
4.  **Optimize Battle Strategy:** Refine the battle strategy to efficiently defeat wild Pokémon while minimizing damage taken. Perhaps explore other moves beyond the first move (Tackle) when available.
