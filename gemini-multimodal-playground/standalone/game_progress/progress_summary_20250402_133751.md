# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Current Goal:** Explore the world and encounter a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Route 2.
*   **Party:** Pidgey (Current HP unknown).
*   **Status Effects:** None known.
*   **Overall Condition:** Healthy, recently healed.

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 55-64)

Our trainer has been focused on the initial exploration and healing our Pidgey. The following actions were taken:

*   **Turn 55:** Initial assessment reveals Pidgey is low on health.
*   **Turns 56-58:** Attempting to locate tall grass, but initially unsure of location and resources.
*   **Turn 59:** The Pokémon Center and Poke Mart were identified.
*   **Turn 60:** Pidgey was successfully healed at the Pokémon Center. Health status is now managed with better awareness.
*   **Turn 61-63:** Exited the Pokemon Center and are now venturing on Route 2 in search of tall grass.
*   **Turn 64:** Continuing to travel Route 2, still looking for tall grass.

## III. Key Discoveries

*   **Pokémon Center Location:** Successfully located and utilized the Pokémon Center for healing.
*   **Poke Mart Location:** Identified the Poke Mart for future supply needs.
*   **Route 2:** Discovered a new route that is being explored now.

## IV. Challenges and Obstacles

*   **Navigation:** Initial difficulty in identifying surroundings and locations. The lack of coordinate information makes remembering locations difficult.
*   **Resource Management:** Initially unsure of Pidgey's HP status, highlighting the need for better HP tracking.
*   **Pikachu Encounter:** Still haven't found any tall grass to encounter wild pokemon.

## V. Strategies and Insights

*   **Prioritizing Healing:** Successfully prioritized healing Pidgey to maintain its viability.
*   **Exploration:** Focusing on moving to new locations, such as Route 2, to expand the search area.
*   **Location Awareness:** Becoming more aware of key locations like the Pokémon Center and Poke Mart.

## VI. Next Objectives

1.  **Locate Tall Grass on Route 2:** Continue exploring Route 2 to find an area with tall grass where wild Pokémon, including hopefully a Pikachu, can be encountered.
2.  **Encounter Wild Pokémon:** Once tall grass is found, actively engage in battles to level up the team and potentially find a Pikachu.
3.  **Monitor Pokémon Health:** Continuously track Pidgey's HP and return to the Pokémon Center when needed.
