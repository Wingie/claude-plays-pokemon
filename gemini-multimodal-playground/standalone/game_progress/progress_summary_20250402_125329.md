# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report (Turns 85-94)

**Current Status:**

Currently engaged in battling to achieve the primary objective: winning battles and learning how to fight. Our Pokémon has gained experience and is actively engaging in combat. We are successfully navigating the battle interface and progressing towards understanding combat mechanics.

**Recent Actions:**

*   **Battle Engagement:** Consistently entering and engaging in battles, primarily against wild Pokémon.
*   **Attack Selection:** Prioritizing the use of Tackle (or the first attack option available) as the strongest known attack.
*   **Battle Progression:** Successfully navigating the battle interface by selecting "Fight" and then the appropriate attack.
*   **Victory Achieved:** Successfully defeated a Wild Pidgey, earning 23 experience points.
*   **Post-Battle Navigation:** Recognized the need to advance text and return to the overworld after a successful battle.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   **Tackle Effectiveness:** Tackle appears to be a reasonably effective attack at the current stage of the game.
*   **Experience Gain:** Defeating Pokémon yields experience points, contributing to our Pokémon's growth.
*   **Battle Flow:** Understanding the basic flow of battles, including attack selection, enemy defeat, experience gain, and the return to the overworld.
*   **Post-Battle Prompts:** Recognition of the need to press "A" to progress through post-battle text and return to the overworld.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Limited Attack Options:** Currently relying on a single attack (Tackle), which might become less effective against diverse opponents.
*   **Strategic Depth:** Lacking in-depth understanding of type matchups and more advanced combat strategies.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Return to Overworld:** Execute the plan to press 'A' and return to the overworld.
2.  **Continue Battle Search:** Resume searching for wild Pokémon to engage in further battles.
3.  **Observe Battle Outcomes:** Pay closer attention to the effectiveness of Tackle against different Pokémon types.
4.  **Explore Menu Options:** Investigate other options in the battle menu beyond "Fight" (e.g., "Bag," "Pokémon," "Run") to expand tactical possibilities.
5.  **Identify New Moves:** Look for opportunities to learn new and potentially stronger moves.
6.  **Monitor Pokémon Stats:** Keep track of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.) to understand its strengths and weaknesses.

**Overall Assessment:**

Significant progress has been made in understanding the basic mechanics of battles. The consistent application of Tackle has proven effective in at least one successful battle. The next step is to broaden the understanding of available options and begin experimenting with more advanced strategies as the Pokémon levels up and learns new abilities. We are actively learning and achieving the objective!
