# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Expedition

**Reporting Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest. We are currently moving between being in tall grass and outside of it.
*   **Party:** Our lead Pokémon is currently at full health (29/29 HP).
*   **Progress:** We've been primarily battling Weedle in Viridian Forest. No Pikachu encounters yet.

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 5-14)

*   **Turns 5-7:** After entering Viridian Forest we spent several turns outside of the grass and tried to move to the left to get inside the grass to look for pokemon.
*   **Turns 8-13:** Focus has been on battling Weedle. We've learned to use Gust, a super-effective move against Bug/Poison types like Weedle, to quickly defeat them.
*   **Turns 13-14:** After winning a battle, we have been taking three random steps (Up, Right, Up) to try and trigger new encounters in the tall grass. This strategy is designed to maximize our chances of finding a Pikachu.

## III. Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Type Effectiveness:** Gust is a highly effective move against Weedle, significantly speeding up battles and minimizing potential damage taken.
*   **Weedle Abundance:** Weedle encounters are very common in the area we are exploring. We have faced them multiple times in a row.
*   **Location Management:** Navigating in and out of the tall grass patches. We have to make sure to be inside of the grass to get wild encounters.
*   **No Pikachu Yet:** Despite extensive exploration and battles, we haven't encountered a Pikachu. This suggests it might be rarer than initially anticipated, or we need to adjust our search strategy (e.g., exploring different areas within Viridian Forest).

## IV. Challenges Faced

*   **Repetitive Encounters:** Constant Weedle battles slow down our progress towards finding Pikachu.
*   **Pikachu Elusiveness:** Pikachu has not been encountered, suggesting it might be a rare spawn.
*   **Location Awareness:** Determining where to go to reliably be *inside* tall grass to trigger encounters.

## V. Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Pikachu Search:** Keep exploring Viridian Forest.
2.  **Refine Movement Strategy:** If random movements prove unproductive, consider a more structured grid-based search pattern within the tall grass to ensure complete coverage.
3.  **Conserve PP:** While Gust is effective, we need to be mindful of its PP. If necessary, switch to Tackle to conserve PP, especially against lower-level Weedle.
4.  **Explore Different Areas:** If Pikachu remains elusive, move to different areas of Viridian Forest to explore new encounter zones.
