# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   In battle with a wild Pidgey.
*   Pikachu's HP: 16/19.
*   Currently stuck in the BAG menu.

**Recent Actions & Observations:**

*   (Turns 5 & 6): Initiated battle with a wild Pidgey. Waiting for battle menu to appear. Action: Pressed A to advance dialogue.
*   (Turns 7, 8, 9 & 10): Battle menu visible. Initially attempted to select "THUNDERSHOCK." Action: Right, then A.
*   (Turns 11, 12, 13 & 14): Accidentally navigated into the BAG menu. Attempting to return to the FIGHT menu. Action: B, then A.

**Key Discoveries & Challenges:**

*   **Battle Initiation:** Successfully triggered a battle encounter.
*   **Menu Navigation Issues:** Experiencing difficulty navigating the battle menus, repeatedly getting stuck in the BAG menu. This suggests an error in button presses.
*   **Move Selection:** Identified "THUNDERSHOCK" as the preferred attack move for Pikachu against Pidgey.
*   **Looping Behavior:** The agent is stuck in a loop, repeatedly attempting to select THUNDERSHOCK from the FIGHT menu, despite being in the BAG menu. This indicates an issue with state tracking or action execution.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Escape the BAG Menu:** Press the "B" button to exit the BAG menu and return to the main battle menu (FIGHT, BAG, POKEMON, RUN).
2.  **Select "FIGHT":** Press the "A" button to select the "FIGHT" option from the main battle menu.
3.  **Select "THUNDERSHOCK":** Navigate to "THUNDERSHOCK" (presumably using the "Right" button) and press "A" to execute the move.
4.  **Continue Leveling:** Once the Pidgey is defeated, continue battling wild Pokémon in the area to gain experience and level up Pikachu.
5.  **Improve Action Execution:** Investigate the root cause of getting stuck in the BAG menu and implement more robust action execution to avoid future loops.

**Insights & Strategies:**

*   **Menu Order:** Understand and remember the order of actions needed to perform a move in battle (Exit Bag, Fight, Move).
*   **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to prevent the agent from getting stuck in loops due to unexpected menu states.
*   **State Tracking:** Improve state tracking to accurately determine the current menu and available actions.
