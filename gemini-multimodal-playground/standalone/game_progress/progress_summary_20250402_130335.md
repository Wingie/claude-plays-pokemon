# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on context of "recent turns")

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

*   **Pokémon Health:** HAN is currently at full health (19/19 HP) following potion use.
*   **Location:** Actively engaging in wild Pokémon battles.
*   **Items:** Possess potions for healing.

## Recent Actions (Turns 85-94)

*   **Healing:** Successfully used a Potion on Pokémon HAN to restore HP from a critical low.
*   **Battles:** Engaged in multiple battles with Pidgey using the first attack option.
*   **Escape:** One battle resulted in successfully escaping.
*   **Menu Navigation:** Navigated the items menu multiple times, using and exiting it.

## Key Discoveries and Observations

*   **Potions are Effective:** Potions successfully restore HP, allowing HAN to continue battling.
*   **Pidgey Encounters:** Encountering Pidgey frequently suggests this Pokémon is common in the current area.
*   **Item Menu Issues:** Repeated attempts to exit the item menu suggest potential issues with user experience.

## Next Objectives

*   **Continue Battling:** Persist in battling wild Pokémon to gain experience and progress.
*   **Refine Battle Strategy:** Evaluate the effectiveness of the "first attack option" against Pidgey. Consider diversifying attacks if battles are inefficient.
*   **Minimize Item Menu Errors:** Reduce accidental item menu activations to ensure more efficient battles.
*   **Monitor Pokémon Health:** Vigilantly check HAN's HP and use potions proactively to prevent near-death situations.
