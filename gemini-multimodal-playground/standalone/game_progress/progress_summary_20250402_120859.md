# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

## Current Status

Our primary goal is to train our Mankey and increase its level by engaging in battles. However, recent battles have resulted in several Pokémon fainting, leading to setbacks. We have successfully caught a Pidgey.

## Recent Actions (Turns 35-44)

*   **Focused Training:**  We primarily engaged in battles, repeatedly using Mankey's "Scratch" attack in an attempt to level up.
*   **Consecutive Faints:**  Several battles resulted in our Pokémon fainting. We repeatedly confirmed the use of the next available Pokémon by pressing 'A' when prompted with "Use next POKéMON?".
*   **Desperate Measures:** Facing the possibility of a total wipeout, we attempted to catch a Heedle using Poké Balls.
*   **Success!** We successfully caught a Pidgey!

## Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Heedle Encounter:**  We encountered a Heedle, indicating its presence in the current area.
*   **Resource Management:**  The need to use the next Pokémon repeatedly highlights the importance of resource management and team depth, which we currently lack.
*   **Catching Strategy:** While focused on training, catching wild Pokémon might be necessary to diversify our team and reduce the risk of game overs.
*   **Team Expansion:** Successfully captured Pidgey increases our active roster.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Pokémon Fainting:** Frequent faints are hindering progress and potentially draining resources (Potions/Revives if we had them).
*   **Low Team Depth:**  The repeated prompting to use the next Pokémon suggests a limited number of available Pokémon in our party, making battles difficult.
*   **Black Screen Uncertainty:**  The black screen episode after another faint suggests potential problems with the game's handling of multiple faints in a row.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Assess Pidgey:** Evaluate the stats and abilities of the newly caught Pidgey to determine its potential contribution to the team.
2.  **Continue Leveling Mankey:** Despite the difficulties, we must continue to train Mankey. We may need to adjust our training location to find easier battles.
3.  **Explore Team Composition:** Consider strategies for the longer battles ahead.
4.  **Acquire Healing Items:** Secure Potions or other healing items to improve our team's survivability and reduce the frequency of faints.
5.  **Strategically Catch More Pokemon:** Continue trying to catch more Pokemon to expand roster.

## Conclusion

While progress has been slow and challenging, the successful capture of Pidgey offers a glimmer of hope. Addressing the team's weaknesses and focusing on strategic resource management will be critical for future success.
