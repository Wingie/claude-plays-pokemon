# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 10-19

**Current Goal:** Find and Win Pokémon Battles

## Current Status

*   Lead Pokémon: Healthy (15/21 HP)
*   Location: Overworld, in tall grass.
*   Objective: Actively seeking Pokémon battles.
*   Game State: Recovering and exiting from battle end screens.

## Recent Actions

*   **Battle Engagements:** Successfully won several battles against wild Pokémon (primarily Rattata).
*   **HP Monitoring:** Consistently checking lead Pokémon's HP to ensure it stays above 30% of max HP to avoid immediate need for healing.
*   **Leveling Up:** Lead Pokemon has leveled up, as evidenced by the repeated level up screens.
*   **Exploration:** Actively moving through tall grass in the overworld to trigger encounters.
*   **Screen Navigation:** Repeatedly pressing 'A' to advance through EXP gain and level up screens after battles.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Battle-Overworld Cycle:** Confirmed the predictable cycle of battle encounter -> battle win -> EXP screen -> level up screen (if applicable) -> return to overworld.
*   **HP Threshold:** Established a strategy of monitoring HP and comparing it to 30% of max HP as a threshold for considering healing.
*   **Tall Grass Mechanics:** Reaffirmed that tall grass is the primary location for triggering wild Pokémon encounters.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Seeking Battles:** Prioritize moving within tall grass to trigger more Pokémon encounters.
2.  **Maintain HP Monitoring:** Continuously check lead Pokémon's HP after each battle and be prepared to adjust strategy if HP falls below the 30% threshold.
3.  **Overworld Navigation:** Continue to navigate the overworld, focusing on areas with tall grass to maximize encounter opportunities.
4.  **React to Level Ups:** Be prepared to acknowledge level up screens and continue to press A.
