# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   **Location:** Exiting Gary's House in Pallet Town.
*   **Objective:** Complete (Acquired Town Map).
*   **Long-Term Goal:** Explore the world and try to encounter a Pikachu.

**Recent Actions & Narrative Summary:**

The player began outside of Pallet Town, north of their destination. The initial objective was to return to Pallet Town and obtain the Town Map from Gary's sister (Daisy). The journey involved navigating south, accidentally entering the Pokémon Center, and then correctly identifying and entering Gary's house.

Dialogue with Daisy resulted in acquiring the Town Map. Several turns were then spent navigating through dialogue and menu screens.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   **Town Map Acquired:** The primary objective for the recent turns has been successfully completed.
*   **Pallet Town Layout:** Identified the location of Gary's house within Pallet Town.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Navigation:** Initial misdirection led to entering the Pokémon Center, demonstrating a learning curve in understanding the overworld map.
*   **Dialogue/Menu Management:** Multiple turns were spent exiting dialogue boxes and menu screens after acquiring the Town Map. This suggests the need to optimize input handling and potentially predict the number of button presses required to exit these states.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Exit Gary's House Completely:** Ensure the player is back on the Pallet Town overworld map.
2.  **Re-evaluate Goal:** Now that the Town Map is acquired, the player should focus on the long-term goal: "Explore the world and try to encounter a Pikachu".
3.  **Begin Exploration:** Decide on an initial route for exploration. Consider Viridian Forest as a potential early location for Pikachu encounters, based on general Pokémon knowledge.
4.  **Define Default Behavior:** Establish a clear strategy for exploration and battle (currently undefined). This includes direction of movement, interaction with NPCs, and handling Pokémon encounters.
