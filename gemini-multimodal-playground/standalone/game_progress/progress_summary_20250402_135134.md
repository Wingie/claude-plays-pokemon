# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest (exploring the tall grass)
*   **Party:** Pidgey (Level 10, full HP)
*   **Objective Status:** Progressing slowly. Encounters have been frequent, but not with the target Pokémon (Pikachu).

## II. Recent Actions

*   **Battle Summary Navigation:** Spent several turns navigating battle summary screens after defeating wild Pokémon.
*   **Battle Encounters:** Primarily battling Rattata.
*   **Move Selection:** Consistently used Gust and Tackle with Pidgey in battles.
*   **Exploration:** Initiated random movement in the tall grass within Viridian Forest to trigger encounters.

## III. Key Discoveries and Challenges

*   **Encounter Rate:** Wild Pokémon encounters in the tall grass are frequent.
*   **Pokémon Diversity (Limited):** So far, the only encountered Pokémon has been Rattata, which is not the target.
*   **Resource Management (HP):** Pidgey's HP has remained at full. No need for healing items or Pokémon Center visits.
*   **Experience Gain:** Pidgey has gained experience, but the exact level is not being precisely tracked in the provided turn reports, apart from a one-time level up to 10.
*   **Navigation:** Moving somewhat aimlessly; the strategy consists only of moving in a set of three steps in a random directions without more in-depth mapping.

## IV. Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Exploring Viridian Forest:** Persist in navigating the tall grass, prioritizing random movement for now, to increase the chance of encountering a Pikachu.
2.  **Maintain HP Levels:** Monitor Pidgey's HP to ensure it remains healthy and ready for battle.
3.  **Adjust Movement Strategy:** If Rattata are encountered too much without seeing other Pokémon, consider a slight change of plans, such as trying to systematically explore each area of the forest, to ensure that the environment is explored and that you don't spend too much time in one spot.
4.  **Adapt Battle Strategy (If Necessary):** If the encounter rate of new Pokémon goes up, adjust battle strategy based on type matchups and Pokémon weaknesses.

## V. Insights

*   The current strategy of purely random movement is yielding many encounters with Rattata but not necessarily Pikachu. A more structured approach to explore could improve efficiency.
*   The consistent battles are providing experience, but defeating the same opponent is slowing progression in terms of variety and new discoveries.
*   Monitoring HP is crucial for continued exploration, but the current lack of damage taken means that HP is a low priority.
