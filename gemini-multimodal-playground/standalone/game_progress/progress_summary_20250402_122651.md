# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Mankey is at Level 5 with 8/19 HP.
*   We are currently in the overworld, attempting to heal Mankey at a Pokémon Center before resuming battle training.

**Recent Actions:**

*   **Initial Exploration (Turns 0-4):** Began exploring tall grass area in search of battles. Encountered an obstacle preventing upward movement.
*   **Battle Success (Turns 48-49):** Successfully engaged and defeated a wild Rattata with Mankey. Mankey gained 16 EXP.
*   **Identified Need for Healing (Turns 50-52):** Recognized Mankey's low HP and prioritized healing over immediate battle seeking. Accessed the Pokémon menu, observed Charmander and Weedle, and then began process of exiting the menu and moving to a Pokémon Center.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   **Game Mechanic:** Tall grass areas yield random encounters with wild Pokémon.
*   **Obstacles:** Impassable terrain blocks movement in certain directions.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Heal Mankey:** Locate and utilize a Pokémon Center to restore Mankey's HP to full.
2.  **Return to Battle:** Once healed, resume exploration of the tall grass to engage in more battles.
3.  **Level Up Mankey:** Focus on gaining EXP to level up Mankey through continued battles.
4.  **Resource Assessment:** After healing, check inventory to see if any potions can be used for future healing.
