# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Expedition

**Current Status:**

*   Exploring Viridian Forest.
*   Not currently in battle, but recently finished a battle with a Caterpie.
*   Objective: Find and catch a Pikachu.
*   No confirmed sightings of Pikachu yet.

**Recent Actions (Turns 0-9):**

*   **Initial Exploration & Battle Encounters:** Turns 0-7 consisted primarily of encountering and battling Caterpie. The strategy employed was consistently to select the first available move, eventually identified as "Scratch."
*   **Battle Completion:** Turn 8 marked the defeat of a Caterpie, transitioning the screen to the battle summary.
*   **Clearing Battle Summary:** Turns 8 and 9 involved navigating the battle summary screen by repeatedly pressing the 'A' button. The `is_clearing_battle_summary` flag has been enabled to reflect the screen clearing process.

**Key Discoveries/Observations:**

*   **Encounter Rate:** Caterpie encounters appear to be frequent.
*   **Available Moves:** Our Pokémon has access to the moves Scratch, Leer, and Low Kick (at least by turn 6).
*   **Battle Summary Navigation:** The game requires multiple 'A' presses to exit the battle summary screen.
*   **Location Consistency:** The exploration is happening within Tall Grass.
*   **Missing Information:** Missing health and Poke Ball information limits our strategic planning.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Repetitive Encounters:** Frequent Caterpie battles, slowing down Pikachu search.
*   **Lack of Information:** The missing health and Poke Ball data makes it difficult to develop more sophisticated strategies (e.g., knowing when to use items or attempt to catch a Pokemon).
*   **No Pikachu Sightings:** The primary objective has not been achieved yet.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Continue Exploring Viridian Forest:** Persist in navigating the forest to increase the chances of encountering a Pikachu.
2.  **Maintain Battle Readiness:** Continue battling encountered Pokémon to gain experience, while prioritizing encounters that might be different.
3.  **Gather More Information:** Determine how to access and display crucial data like remaining Pokémon health and Poke Ball count, essential for strategic decision-making.
4.  **Prepare for Capture:** When a Pikachu is encountered, we need to be ready to use a Poke Ball.  Until Pokeball data can be collected, always select to catch a pokemon.
