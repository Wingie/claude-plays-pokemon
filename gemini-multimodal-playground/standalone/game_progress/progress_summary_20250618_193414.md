# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Current Goal:** Find battles to level up Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently stuck in a bugged battle state after defeating a Caterpie.
*   **Party:**
    *   Pikachu: HP 14/20. Needs healing.
*   **Objective Status:** Leveling up Pikachu is on hold due to a persistent battle loop.

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 30-39)

The past several turns have been dedicated to addressing a persistent bug encountered during a battle with a Wild Caterpie. The game appears to be stuck on the move selection screen even after the Caterpie has fainted.

*   **Turns 30-33:** Attempted to select "Thundershock" to attack Caterpie, but the game state didn't progress despite repeated actions. Suspect the action wasn't registered due to the loop.
*   **Turns 34-39:** Recognized the game was stuck in a loop after Caterpie fainted. The focus shifted to attempting to exit the battle by repeatedly pressing the "A" button to advance the dialogue, but this has been unsuccessful so far.

## III. Key Discoveries and Challenges

*   **Bug Encountered:** A significant bug has been identified where the game fails to properly exit a battle after defeating an opponent, resulting in a repeating move selection screen.
*   **Low Health:** Pikachu's HP is critically low (14/20), making the situation precarious. Any further action that may cause damage could lead to a loss.
*   **Limited Options:** The current situation limits available actions. The primary focus is on finding a way to exit the bugged battle state.
*   **Thundershock Potential:** When not bugged, Thundershock appears to be a viable move to defeat Caterpie.

## IV. Next Objectives

1.  **Exit the Bugged Battle:** Continue to attempt to exit the battle loop by pressing "A" repeatedly. Explore alternative button combinations (Start, Select, B) to potentially reset the game state if pressing "A" fails.
2.  **Heal Pikachu:** Immediately after exiting the battle, prioritize healing Pikachu at the nearest Pokémon Center to prevent fainting.
3.  **Resume Leveling:** Once Pikachu is healed, resume the initial goal of finding battles to level up Pikachu. Focus on weak Pokémon like Caterpie and Weedle to gain experience safely.
4.  **Document Bug:** Note the circumstances leading to the bug (location, opponent, actions taken) to avoid repeating the same scenario in the future.

## V. Strategic Considerations

*   **Patience is Key:** The bugged state requires patience and persistence. It may take several attempts to find a way out.
*   **Prioritize Survival:** Pikachu's low health is a major concern. Any risky actions should be avoided until healed.
*   **Adaptive Strategy:** The emergence of this bug necessitates an adaptive strategy. Focus on resolving the immediate crisis before returning to the original plan.
