*   **Turns 23-29:** Defeated the Weedle. Currently in the process of clearing the battle summary screen by repeatedly pressing the "A" button. The selected action was `A`.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Viridian Forest contains Weedle.
*   "Scratch" is a viable move against Weedle.
*   Multiple "A" button presses are required to clear the battle summary screen.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   The immediate challenge is exiting the battle summary screen.
*   Encountering numerous Weedle has diverted focus from the primary objective of finding Pikachu.

**Next Objectives:**

2.  **Pikachu Hunt:** Resume exploring Viridian Forest, focusing on areas where Pikachu are likely to appear.
3.  **Resource Management:** Monitor Pokémon health and inventory of Poké Balls to ensure readiness for catching Pikachu.
4.  **Strategy Adjustment:** If Weedle encounters are excessive, consider exploring different areas of the forest or adjusting movement patterns.
