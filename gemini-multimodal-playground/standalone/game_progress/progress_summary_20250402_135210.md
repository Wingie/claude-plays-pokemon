# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest Exploration

**Date:** Current Date (Replace with actual date)

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest, near coordinates (2, 11).
*   **Environment:** Primarily navigating through tall grass, where wild Pokémon encounters are frequent.
*   **Overall:** Focused on random movement within tall grass to trigger encounters.  Still trying to find and catch a Pikachu.

## Recent Actions

*   **Exited Battle Summary Screens (Turns 0-3):** Repeatedly pressed "A" to dismiss battle summary screens after leveling up and gaining EXP, indicating recent battles.
*   **Random Movement in Tall Grass (Turns 4-8):** Executed sequences of random movements (Up, Down, Left, Right) within tall grass to initiate wild Pokémon encounters.

## Key Discoveries & Observations

*   **Viridian Forest Navigation:** Established a base location near coordinates (2, 11) within Viridian Forest.
*   **Encountering Wild Pokémon:** Successfully triggered wild Pokémon battles through random movement in the tall grass.  Note:  Rattata was encountered and fainted.
*   **No Pikachu Encounters Yet:** Despite multiple encounters, Pikachu has not been found.

## Challenges & Obstacles

*   **Repetitive Battle Summaries:**  Experiencing frequent battle summary screens which disrupt exploration flow.
*   **Randomness of Encounters:**  Relying on random movement, which can be inefficient for finding specific Pokémon (Pikachu).
*   **No Progress on Pikachu Capture:** Still haven't seen a Pikachu in the wild, despite the focus on tall grass navigation.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Random Exploration:** Persist with random movement in the tall grass of Viridian Forest to increase the probability of encountering Pikachu.
2.  **Monitor Encounter Rate:**  Track the types of Pokémon encountered to assess the effectiveness of current location and strategy.
3.  **Consider Location Shift:** If Pikachu encounters remain elusive after a reasonable amount of exploration, consider exploring other areas of Viridian Forest.
4.  **(Future) Prepare Capture Strategy:** Once a Pikachu is encountered, ensure we have Poké Balls and are prepared to weaken the Pokémon without causing it to faint, maximizing capture chances.
