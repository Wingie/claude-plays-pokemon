# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Report Period:** Turns 47 - 59

**Current Goal:** Navigate to Viridian City and locate the blue-roofed PokeMart.

## Current Status

We are currently located south of Viridian Forest, attempting to navigate north to reach Viridian City. Our progress is hampered by environmental obstacles (ledges) and non-player characters (NPCs) obstructing our path. We are immediately south of the forest entrance, facing a trainer blocking our direct path north.

## Recent Actions

The last several turns have focused on maneuvering around obstacles to the north and east of our location. The following actions were taken:

*   Repeated attempts to move around a ledge blocking the direct path north.
*   Attempts to move right to circumvent the ledge and nearby people.
*   Continued attempts to move north towards the ultimate goal, Viridian City.
* Decision to interact with the trainer blocking our path north to the forest,

## Key Discoveries

*   **Environmental Obstacles:** Ledges are preventing a direct northward path.
*   **NPC Obstacles:** NPCs are strategically positioned, requiring us to navigate around them.
*   **Trainer Encounter:** A trainer is currently blocking the direct path towards the Viridian Forest entrance and our progress towards Viridian City.

## Strategies and Analysis

*   **Movement Strategy:** Our initial strategy of moving around obstacles has been slow but necessary. Navigating through the game world requires careful observation and adaptation to the environment.
*   **Obstacle Avoidance:** Attempts to move around the ledge and people have been mostly successful, although time-consuming.
*   **Trainer Interaction:** Due to the trainer blocking the way, a battle is unavoidable to progress forward.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Engage the Trainer:** Initiate a battle with the trainer blocking the path by interacting with them.
2.  **Defeat Trainer:** Win the battle to clear the path to Viridian City.
3.  **Proceed to Viridian City:** Once the path is clear, continue heading north, taking care to move around all remaining people.
4.  **Locate PokeMart:** Once in Viridian City, search for the PokeMart with the distinctive blue roof.

## Risks and Considerations

*   **Trainer Battle Difficulty:** We may encounter a challenging battle with the blocking trainer. It's recommended that we assess the trainer's Pokemon and strategize accordingly.
*   **Navigation Errors:** Given the confined space and multiple obstacles, there is a risk of getting stuck or backtracking. Focused observation and planning are crucial.
