# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently engaged in a battle.
*   **Lead Pokémon:** Pikachu
*   **Pikachu's HP:** 14/19
*   **Opponent:** Rattata
*   **Battle Status:** Active battle; move selection screen visible.
*   **Objective:** Level up Pokémon.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turns 0-9:** The primary action taken was repeated attempts to select and use the move "THUNDERSHOCK" against a Rattata. The agent seemed to be stuck in a loop, repeatedly analyzing the same battle state and planning the same action.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Available Moves:** Pikachu currently knows "GROWL" and "THUNDERSHOCK."
*   **Move Preference:** The agent has determined "THUNDERSHOCK" to be the preferable move in the current battle scenario.
*   **Loop Issue:** The agent has identified a persistent loop in its decision-making process within the battle, indicating a failure to adapt to changing game states or a lack of confirmation that the previous action had the intended effect.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Decision-Making Loop:** The biggest challenge is the inability to break out of the move selection loop. This suggests a potential problem with state tracking or the lack of feedback confirming successful execution of actions.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Debug the Loop:** Investigate the reason for the persistent loop in the battle. This could involve examining the state management, action execution, and reward/feedback mechanisms. Specifically:
    *   Is the move actually being executed?
    *   Is the game state updating after the move is *supposed* to be executed?
    *   Is the agent correctly reading the game state *after* it attempts to execute the move?
2.  **Implement Error Handling:** Add error handling to the battle sequence to prevent getting stuck in similar loops. For example, if "THUNDERSHOCK" is selected repeatedly without effect, try a different action or assess if the opponent is immune.
3.  **Resume Leveling:** Once the loop is resolved, continue battling to level up Pikachu, as per the current objective.

## Insights and Strategies (Failed)

*   **Selecting "THUNDERSHOCK":** The strategy of repeatedly selecting "THUNDERSHOCK" against the Rattata proved ineffective due to the underlying loop issue. While the move itself might be effective in principle, the agent was unable to progress due to this problem.
