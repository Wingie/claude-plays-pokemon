# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest (Still inside)
*   **Objective:** Find and catch a Pikachu.
*   **Party Health:** Lead Pokémon needs healing (HP: 24/31).
*   **In Battle:** Currently engaged in battle.

## Recent Actions (Turns 55-64)

The primary activity in the recent turns revolved around navigating Viridian Forest with the long-term goal of finding a Pikachu, but being temporarily detoured by the more urgent need to heal.

*   **Turns 55-58:** Repeatedly attempted to exit the forest by moving left, based on the assumption that Viridian City was to the west. The bot recognized that this strategy resulted in it being stuck in a loop and apologized for the repetition. This indicates some flaws in state tracking.
*   **Turns 59-61:** Adjusted strategy after recognizing being stuck, attempting to move down instead.
*   **Turns 62-64:** Encountered a wild Caterpie. Prioritized finishing the battle using Tackle.

## Key Discoveries & Challenges

*   **Challenge:** Initial navigation strategy (moving left) failed to get out of Viridian Forest, leading to a repeated loop. This indicates a lack of mapping and inefficient exploration. The bot realized this and made changes.
*   **Discovery:** The agent is aware of being stuck in a loop and attempts to correct its behaviour by trying different movement strategies.
*   **Discovery:** Wild Pokémon encounters are frequent in Viridian Forest, as anticipated.
*   **Challenge:** Lead Pokémon health is low, making exploration dangerous and forcing a temporary shift in priorities. The agent correctly identifies the need for healing but must address current obstacles first.
*   **Reinforcement:** The agent is still unable to reach the Viridian City PC.
*   **Optimization Needed**: Error handling and loop detection have been addressed but can be improved in future iterations.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Complete Current Battle:** Finish the battle against the Caterpie.
2.  **Prioritize Healing:** After the battle, immediately attempt to navigate to Viridian City Pokémon Center for healing. Focus on reliable navigation.
3.  **Resume Pikachu Search:** Once the Pokémon are healed, return to Viridian Forest and systematically search for a Pikachu.
4.  **Improve Navigation:** Investigate better navigation strategies within Viridian Forest. Consider a more methodical approach (e.g., exploring each area systematically instead of random directions). Maybe acquire a map in the future.
