# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and find a Pikachu to catch.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest, exploring tall grass.
*   **Lead Pokémon:** Pidgey.
*   **Pidgey's HP:** 26/29 (Sustained minor damage)
*   **Poké Balls:** Unknown (Needs to be tracked).
*   **Needs Healing:** No.
*   **Pikachu Sighted:** No.

## Recent Actions

*   **Initial Exploration:** Started exploring Viridian Forest, moving randomly within the tall grass to trigger encounters (Turns 0-2).
*   **Wild Encounters:** Initiated multiple encounters.
    *   **Caterpie Battles (Turns 7-9):** Engaged in at least one prolonged battle with a Caterpie. Pidgey sustained damage but emerged victorious. Selected "Fight" and defaulted to the first move.
    *   **Post-Battle Recovery (Turns 10-13):** Repeatedly seeing the experience gain screen, indicating multiple battles have concluded. Each battle awarded Pidgey 30 EXP. We are currently transitioning out of battle screens and will resume exploration.
*   **Movement Strategy:** Implemented a pattern of 3 random movements to trigger encounters. The specific sequence chosen was Right, Up, Right in early turns and then Up, Right, Up after battles.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Encounter Rate:** Random movement in tall grass reliably triggers battles.
*   **Viridian Forest Pokémon:** Encountered Caterpie and Pidgey.
*   **Experience Gain:** Pidgey is gaining experience from battles, awarding 30 EXP per battle.
*   **HP Management:** Pidgey has sustained minor damage during battles. While not requiring immediate healing, HP should be monitored.
*   **Move Selection Strategy:** Currently defaulting to the first move in battle. It is important to learn and utilize Pidgey's moves.

## Challenges

*   **Finding Pikachu:** Pikachu has not been encountered yet. The random movement strategy needs to continue until a Pikachu appears.
*   **HP Maintenance:** Sustaining even minor damage in each battle will eventually require healing.
*   **Resource Management:** Number of Pokeballs are unknown and thus the team lacks the ability to catch any of the wild Pokemon.
*   **Tracking Coordinates:** Unable to track exact coordinates within the forest. This makes efficient exploration difficult.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Exploring Viridian Forest:** Maintain the current strategy of random movement in tall grass to trigger encounters, while trying to cover as much ground as possible.
2.  **Identify and Prioritize Pikachu:** If a Pikachu appears, prioritize attempting to catch it using a Poké Ball.
3.  **Poké Ball Inventory:** Attempt to gain knowledge of pokeball count.
4.  **Monitor Pidgey's HP:** Closely track Pidgey's health. If HP gets too low (estimated below 10), head to Viridian City PC to heal.
5.  **Learn Pidgey's Moves:** Understand Pidgey's moveset and develop a more strategic approach to battles, to better leverage available moves.
