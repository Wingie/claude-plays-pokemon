# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Head north to Viridian City and locate the PokeMart (blue roof).

**Current Status:**

*   Trainer is located in a forest area, seemingly south of Viridian City.
*   Primary Pokémon: Charmander, Level 9, HP 9/27.
*   Currently engaged in a wild Pidgey battle.
*   Progression towards Viridian City is temporarily halted due to wild Pokémon encounters.

**Recent Actions:**

*   **Turn 0-4:** Attempted to catch a Pidgey using Charmander's Ember attack to weaken it. The outcome of this capture attempt is unknown.
*   **Turn 68-71:** Navigated a forest area, encountering difficulty due to obstacles (trees). Attempts to move directly north were unsuccessful. A revised strategy of going left then up was proposed.
*   **Turn 73-74:** Entered battle with a new wild Pidgey, interrupting the journey to Viridian City.

**Key Discoveries & Observations:**

*   **Forest Navigation:** Direct northward movement is obstructed by trees, requiring alternative routes.
*   **Pidgey Encounters:** Wild Pidgeys are frequent in the current area, hindering progress toward Viridian City.
*   **Ember Overuse:** Ember is being spammed. The efficacy of Charmander's Ember attack for weakening Pokémon before capture seems low. Alternative strategies and other available moves should be explored.
*   **Resource Management:** Charmander's HP is low (9/27), indicating a need to visit a Pokémon Center in the near future, if available, or utilize healing items.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Resolve Current Pidgey Encounter:** Either defeat or attempt to capture the current wild Pidgey to resume travel.
2.  **Optimize Capture Strategy:** Rethink the strategy for catching Pokémon. Ember spam is inefficient. Consider:
    *   Using Scratch for less damage.
    *   Utilizing status moves like Growl.
    *   Employing Poké Balls earlier in the battle.
3.  **Navigate the Forest:** Implement the revised navigation strategy (left, then up) or explore alternative paths to bypass the tree obstacles and continue north.
4.  **Reach Viridian City:** Proceed north to Viridian City and locate the PokeMart (blue roof).
5.  **Heal Charmander:** Visit the Pokémon Center in Viridian City (if available) or use Potions to restore Charmander's health.
6.  **Restock Items:** Purchase necessary items (Potions, Poké Balls) at the PokeMart.

**Strategic Considerations:**

*   Charmander's low HP poses a risk of fainting. Prioritize healing after battles or consider avoiding unnecessary encounters.
*   The current capture strategy is inefficient. Experiment with different moves and timings for Poké Ball usage.
*   Map awareness is crucial for navigating the forest. Pay attention to landmarks and potential alternate routes.
