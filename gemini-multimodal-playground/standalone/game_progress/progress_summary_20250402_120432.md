# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Located on Route 1, near tall grass, actively seeking wild Pokémon encounters.
*   Charmander is the currently selected Pokémon.
*   Objective is to battle and catch wild Pokémon.

**Recent Actions (Turns 22-31):**

*   **Accidental Re-entry:** Turns 22-24 were spent trying to exit the Pokémon Center after an accidental re-entry. This highlights a need for more careful navigation and awareness of building entrances.
*   **Navigating Obstacles:** In Turn 25, the player successfully navigated a ledge near the Pokémon Center, demonstrating a basic understanding of overworld navigation.
*   **Focus on Tall Grass:** Turns 26-29 saw the player consistently moving into the tall grass on Route 1, indicating a correct understanding that this is where wild Pokémon encounters occur.
*   **Menu Navigation:** Turns 30 and 31 showed menu navigation, with the player correctly exiting a menu and selecting Charmander, indicating a general understanding of game controls.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   **Route 1 Location:** Confirmed that the current location is Route 1, which is a suitable area for finding and battling wild Pokémon.
*   **Tall Grass = Encounters:** Reinforced the connection between tall grass and wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Charmander as Primary:** Established Charmander as the current active Pokémon, ready for battle.

**Challenges Encountered:**

*   **Unintentional Building Entry:** The primary challenge was the accidental re-entry into the Pokémon Center, which wasted several turns. This suggests a need for more precise movement to avoid unwanted interactions.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Initiate Wild Pokémon Battles:** Continue exploring the tall grass on Route 1 to trigger a battle with a wild Pokémon.
2.  **Engage in Battle:** Once a battle is initiated, the player must choose battle actions (attack, switch Pokémon, use item, run) to defeat or capture the wild Pokémon.
3.  **Catch Wild Pokemon:** Attempt to catch any encountered wild Pokémon to expand the team's roster.

**Strategy:**

*   **Focus on Route 1:** Remain on Route 1 to encounter and capture Pokémon appropriate for the early game.
*   **Prioritize Battles:** Prioritize battles to level up Charmander and gain experience.
*   **Experiment with Catching:** Begin experimenting with Poké Balls to catch wild Pokémon when their health is low.
