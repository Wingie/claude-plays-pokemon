# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Report Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up Mankey through battles.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, traversing tall grass areas.
*   **Objective:** Actively seeking Pokémon battles to train Mankey.
*   **Progress:** Minimal progress in actually finding battles and leveling Mankey.

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 65-74)

*   **Primary Action:** Continuously navigating through tall grass areas in search of wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Directional Focus (Turns 65-70):** Initially focused on moving upwards, aiming for new areas with potential battles.
*   **Course Correction (Turn 71):** Recognized a looping behavior while moving upwards and shifted strategy to avoid repeated areas. Began exploring a path to the left.
*   **Continued Exploration (Turns 72-74):** Maintained the westward exploration, choosing the leftward path over an upward, tree-lined one.

## III. Key Discoveries and Challenges

*   **Challenge: Looping Behavior:** Experienced a situation where repetitive upward movement resulted in staying within the same area, hindering progress.
*   **Positive Discovery: Alternative Paths:** Identified a clear path to the left, providing an opportunity to explore new areas and potentially trigger different encounters.
*   **Unconfirmed Potential: Northern Path:** Observed a path moving upward surrounded by trees, its potential for yielding battles is currently unknown.

## IV. Next Objectives

*   **Prioritize Battle Encounters:** Continue actively searching for Pokémon battles within the current area.
*   **Complete Westward Exploration:** Thoroughly explore the path to the left to determine if it yields more frequent battles or different types of Pokémon.
*   **Evaluate Northern Path:** If the westward path proves unfruitful, consider exploring the upward path surrounded by trees to assess its battle potential.
*   **Analyze Encounter Rates:** After a sufficient period of exploration, analyze the encounter rates in different areas to identify the most efficient training grounds for Mankey.
*   **Contingency:** If current area consistently fails to offer battles, consider backtracking to earlier areas or consulting a game guide for optimal training locations.
