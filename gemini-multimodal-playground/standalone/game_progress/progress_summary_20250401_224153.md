# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 28-39

## Current Status

The player is currently located in Viridian City, navigating the initial area after entering the city. The primary goal remains catching a Pidgey within Viridian City.

## Recent Actions & Progress

*   **Exploration & Navigation:** The primary activity has been exploration within Viridian City. Initially, the player experienced difficulty navigating, becoming seemingly stuck in a loop near the city entrance.
*   **Breaking the Loop:** After recognizing the loop, the player attempted to move right to break free.
*   **Path Identification:** After breaking free from the movement loop, the player has identified a clear path leading north.
*   **Northward Progression:** The player has consistently attempted to move north, presumably towards areas where Pidgey may be found.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Viridian City Entrance:** The player has entered Viridian City. The game displays the message "Viridian City: The Eternally Green Paradise".
*   **City Layout:** The player has observed a sign, a building to the right, and a path leading north within Viridian City.
*   **Navigation Challenges:** The player initially encountered navigation issues, becoming temporarily stuck in a movement loop.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Movement Loop:** The most significant challenge was navigating a potential movement loop upon entering Viridian City. This was resolved by attempting a different direction (right).

## Strategies Employed

*   **Direct Movement:** The initial strategy was to move consistently North.
*   **Directional Change:**  When the initial strategy failed, the player intelligently switched direction to break the possible loop.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Northward:** The immediate objective is to continue moving north along the identified path.
2.  **Locate Pidgey Habitat:** Explore the northern part of Viridian City to identify areas where Pidgey are likely to be found.
3.  **Engage and Capture Pidgey:** Initiate an encounter with a Pidgey and attempt to capture it.
