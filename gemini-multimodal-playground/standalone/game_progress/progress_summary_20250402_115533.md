# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Locate and capture a Pikachu. Also in the search for a Pidgey.

## Current Status

*   Exploring areas with grassy patches to encounter Pokémon.
*   Currently in an unidentified location, characterized by grass to the north, west, south, and fences to the east, and rocks to the north.
*   Successfully caught a Mankey.
*   Exited from the capture sequence of the Mankey.

## Recent Actions

*   **Initial Exploration (Turns 0-4):** Prioritized moving north and west to explore grassy areas, following the initial goal of finding a Pikachu. Encountered rocks and fences that blocked progress in some directions.
*   **Mankey Encounter and Capture (Turns 42-46):** Engaged in battle, successfully caught a Mankey. Navigated through the post-capture screens (Pokedex entry, Mankey information, Nickname prompt), choosing to proceed without giving a nickname.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Environment:** The initial area consists primarily of grassy patches interspersed with rocks and fences, limiting movement in some directions.
*   **Pokémon Encounters:** Confirmed the presence of Mankey.
*   **Game Mechanics:** Understood the capture sequence, Pokedex entry, and nickname prompt.

## Obstacles Faced

*   **Environmental Restrictions:** Rocks and fences restricted movement, hindering exploration of certain areas.
*   **Unspecified Location:** Still unaware of current location in the broader game world.
*   **Lack of Pikachu Sightings:** The primary goal of finding a Pikachu has not yet been achieved.
*   **Pidgey Sightings:** Also haven't encountered a Pidgey.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Exploration:** Resume exploring the grassy areas, prioritizing areas not yet visited, to increase the chances of encountering a Pikachu and Pidgey.
2.  **Navigate Environmental Barriers:** Determine if there are ways around or through the rocks and fences to access previously inaccessible areas.
3.  **Identify Location:** Attempt to identify the current location on the game map to inform future exploration strategies.
4. **Capture a Pidgey:** Continue the search for Pidgey.
