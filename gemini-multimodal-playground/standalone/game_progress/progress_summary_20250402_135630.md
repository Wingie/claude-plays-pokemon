# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Viridian Forest

**Date:** October 26, 2023

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest, still in tall grass.
*   **Objective:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.
*   **Party Condition:** Lead Pokémon at full health (29/29 HP). No need for healing.

## Recent Actions (Turns 13-22)

The past ten turns have primarily involved repeated encounters with Weedle in the tall grass of Viridian Forest. After each battle, we've been instructing the character to move randomly in the tall grass in an attempt to trigger another wild Pokémon encounter. The initial movement pattern of Up, Right, Up proved repetitive, so we switched to Down, Left, Right to try and cover more ground.

**Actions Breakdown:**

*   **Turns 13-17:** Moved Up, Right, Up after defeating Weedle each time.
*   **Turns 18-22:** Moved Down, Left, Right after defeating Weedle each time.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Weedle Abundance:** Viridian Forest appears to be heavily populated with Weedle. We've encountered and defeated at least 10 of them in the past few turns.
*   **Pikachu Absence:** Despite our continued exploration, we have yet to encounter a Pikachu. The probability of encountering a Pikachu might be very low or require a different strategy.
*   **Repetitive Pattern:** The repeated movement sequence was getting stuck. Switching to Down, Left, Right was intended to solve this.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Low Encounter Variety:**  Only encountering Weedle is hindering our progress toward leveling up and potentially finding a Pikachu.
*   **Lack of Spatial Awareness:** Without knowledge of our current coordinates, effectively navigating Viridian Forest is difficult. The random movement strategy might be inefficient.
*   **Stuck in Movement Loop:** Initially, the movements were repeating, and we needed to switch that up.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Pikachu Acquisition:** Continue searching for a Pikachu in Viridian Forest. Explore different areas if possible to maximize our chances of encountering one.
2.  **Coordinate Acquisition:** If possible, find a way to determine our current coordinates within Viridian Forest. This would enable more strategic movement.
3.  **Leveling:** Continue battling wild Pokémon to gain experience and level up. Consider a change of scenery if Pikachu proves too elusive.
4.  **Evaluate Movement Strategy:** If the current movement pattern is ineffective, explore alternative navigation strategies within the tall grass. Perhaps alternating between direction changes or prioritizing exploration of unseen areas.
