# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Reporting Period:** Turns 20-29

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

*   We are currently in the tall grass, actively seeking Pokémon battles.
*   Our lead Pokémon's HP is fluctuating but generally remains above 50%. It has decreased from 15/21 to 12/21 through recent battles.

## Recent Actions

*   **Turn 20-21:** Traversed tall grass to trigger encounters. Initial movement was right. After a level up sequence (inferred from turn 21), the game is taking a step in a random direction.
*   **Turns 22-29:** Engaged in successive Pokémon battles. Repeatedly selected "FIGHT" and the first available move ("A," "A").

## Key Discoveries

*   We are successfully triggering Pokémon encounters in the tall grass.
*   Our strategy of selecting "FIGHT" and the first move is resulting in continued battles, though it is causing a slow depletion of HP.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Encountering Pokémon:** Maintain the current strategy of navigating tall grass to trigger battles and fulfill the current goal.
2.  **Monitor Lead Pokémon's HP:** Continuously track the lead Pokémon's HP. If it drops below 30% (6.3 HP), prioritize healing (potion or Pokémon Center).
3. **Track enemy Pokémon:** Begin to keep a list of enemy pokemon to try to learn weaknesses of them.
4.  **Assess Battle Strategy:** Consider the effectiveness of our "FIGHT" -> "First Move" approach. While consistent, it might not be optimal. After gathering more battle data, explore alternative moves and strategies for faster and more efficient victories.
