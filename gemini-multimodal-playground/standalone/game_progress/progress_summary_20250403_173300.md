# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report - Pikachu Hunt

**Current Status:**

*   Currently inside the Viridian City Pokémon Center.
*   Not yet in Viridian Forest.
*   No Pokémon encountered.
*   No healing required.

**Recent Actions (Turns 0-4):**

*   The initial turns involved analysis of the starting location.  It appears we began on top of a building, likely the Pokémon Center roof.
*   The focus has been on identifying the need to reach Viridian Forest to fulfill the primary objective.
*   We are currently stuck *inside* the Viridian City Pokémon Center, despite repeated attempts to exit.

**Key Discoveries & Insights:**

*   **Location Identification:** We have deduced that we are likely in the Viridian City Pokémon Center, which is a crucial waypoint for healing and accessing other areas.
*   **Navigation Challenges:** Exiting the Pokémon Center is proving difficult.  Despite identifying the exit and attempting to move "down," we remain inside.  This suggests a potential input error or misunderstanding of the exit mechanics.
*   **Repeated Observation:** The observation phase has been repeated in the last few turns without significant progress, which indicates that no change happened from the last turn.
*   **Possible Stuck State:** There is a concerning possibility that the agent is "stuck" repeating the same actions without achieving the desired outcome of exiting the PC.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Exit the Pokémon Center:** This is the immediate priority. We need to re-evaluate the exit strategy.  Possible causes of the failure to exit include:
    *   Incorrect input. Verify we are pressing the correct button to move "down."
    *   An obstacle blocking the exit (unlikely).
    *   A bug or limitation in the environment's simulation. We need to find the right input.
2.  **Navigate to Viridian Forest:** Once outside the PC, the next step is to proceed North towards Viridian Forest, based on the initial map analysis.
3.  **Search for Pikachu:** Upon entering the forest, the objective is to find and catch a Pikachu. We will need to explore the forest systematically and prepare for battles with other Pokémon.

**Concerns:**

*   The inability to exit the Pokémon Center is a significant impediment. We need to resolve this immediately.
*   The repeated observation without progress is concerning. It suggests the current strategy is not working and needs revision.

**Action Plan:**

*   **Turn 5: Focus on exiting the PC.** Try the "down" action again. If that fails, try other movement inputs (left, right, up) to see if any triggers the exit.
*   **Document all input/output pairs for exiting.** This will help diagnose the problem if it persists.
*   **If exiting still fails:** Consider resetting the simulation or investigating if other commands might facilitate movement.
