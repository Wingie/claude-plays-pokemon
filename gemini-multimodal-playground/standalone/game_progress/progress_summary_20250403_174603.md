# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

**Current Status:**

*   Currently located on Route 2, (7, 5).
*   Engaged in repeated battles.
*   Lead Pokémon's HP is at 24/24, not requiring healing.
*   Pokéball count is unknown.

**Recent Actions:**

*   Turns 0-4 and 2,3,4: Encountered Weedle repeatedly and executed the "Fight -> First Move" sequence in battle.
*   Turns 11-15: Encountered Rattata repeatedly and executed the "Fight -> First Move" sequence in battle.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   The initial location was unknown, but it has been identified as Route 2.
*   We are continuously encountering wild Pokémon, specifically Weedle and Rattata.
*   A consistent battle strategy of "Fight -> First Move" is being used.
*   The designated location for finding grass-type Pokémon is Viridian Forest, and the Pokécenter is located in Viridian City.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   Repeatedly encountering the same Pokémon (Weedle, Rattata).
*   Looping behaviour in selecting fight and the first move without clear progress in capturing any new Pokemon.
*   Difficulty navigating to Viridian Forest from Route 2.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Navigate to Viridian Forest:** Focus on moving towards the designated grass location to encounter different Pokémon, including Pikachu.  We need to escape Route 2
2.  **Capture Pikachu:** Once in Viridian Forest, prioritize encountering and attempting to catch a Pikachu.  Estimate the number of pokeballs needed and ensure that we have enough.
3.  **Potentially Visit Viridian City PC:** If our Pokémon get injured, heal at the Pokémon Center in Viridian City.

**Strategy Adjustments:**

*   **Implement Escape Strategy:** When encountering unwanted Pokemon such as Weedle or Rattata, add a contingency to run from the battle to conserve resources and move towards the goal of catching Pikachu.
*   **Movement Strategy:** Develop a clear movement plan for navigating from Route 2 to Viridian Forest.
