# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Level up our Pokémon.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** In battle.
*   **Lead Pokémon:** Pikachu.
*   **Pikachu's HP:** 14/20.
*   **Opponent:** Rattata.

## Recent Actions (Turns 50-59)

The recent turns have been focused on a single battle against a Rattata. The strategy has been to repeatedly select "FIGHT," which results in Pikachu using "THUNDERSHO." The turns have alternated between selecting the "FIGHT" option and advancing through the dialogue following the "THUNDERSHO" attack.

Specifically:

*   **Turns 50-52:** Selected "FIGHT" (presumably to access the move selection menu).
*   **Turns 53-59:** Advanced the dialogue following Pikachu's use of "THUNDERSHO."

## Key Discoveries and Observations

*   **Enemy Encounter:** We are consistently encountering Rattata.
*   **Pikachu's Move:** Pikachu is using "THUNDERSHO."
*   **Repetitive Actions:** The strategy has been repetitive. Selecting fight then advancing dialogue of THUNDERSHO
*   **HP Static:** Pikachu's HP has remained constant at 14/20 throughout these turns, suggesting either the Rattata isn't attacking, is dealing negligible damage, or the attacks are missing. It's also possible this information is incorrect or incomplete.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Repetitive Gameplay Loop:** The gameplay has become repetitive, with the same sequence of actions being repeated over and over.
*   **Stamina/Endurance**: Pikachu's current HP is fairly low so the risk of fainting is a problem.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Confirm Battle Outcome:** Determine if the Rattata has been defeated. If not, understand why and adjust strategy.
2.  **Assess Pikachu's HP:** Monitor Pikachu's HP closely. If it drops further, consider using a Potion or switching to a different Pokémon.
3.  **Vary Strategy:** If the Rattata hasn't fainted after several "THUNDERSHO" attacks, explore alternative moves or strategies. Is Thunder Shock even effective against Rattata?
4.  **Level Up Confirmation**: After successfully winning a battle, confirm Pikachu has leveled up.

## Additional Notes

*   The current strategy seems inefficient. Further analysis is needed to understand the effectiveness of "THUNDERSHO" against Rattata.
*   Consider if we need to heal Pikachu to 100%.
