# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up our Pokémon.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently navigating tall grass, triggering frequent wild Pokémon encounters. Most recently, we were in an unknown location at coordinates (4,7)
*   **Pokémon:** We have at least one Pokémon, a Pidgey, currently at level 12 with 31/33 HP
*   **Battle Status:** Frequently engaged in battles with wild Pokémon.

## Recent Actions

*   **Exploration:** Initially attempted a planned movement sequence (right, up, left) within tall grass. Later transitioned to random movement patterns to trigger more wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Battle Engagement:** Consistently entered battles against wild Pokémon, primarily Caterpie.
*   **Move Selection:** Primarily defaulting to the first move ("A") in battle, though recently decided to use Tackle with a Pidgey at coordinate 4,7 against Caterpie.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Frequent Encounters:** Tall grass is consistently triggering wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **Common Opponent:** Caterpie appears to be a common Pokémon in the current area.
*   **Pikachu Encounter:** Successfully encountered a wild Pikachu, indicating its presence in the area, though the encounter may have been transient.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Limited Information:** Initially lacked information about available moves and Pokémon HP during battles. This has been partially addressed.
*   **Repetitive Battles:** Encountering the same Pokémon (Caterpie) repeatedly, potentially hindering efficient leveling.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Leveling:** Persist in battling wild Pokémon to gain experience and level up the team.
2.  **Optimize Move Selection:** Once full move information is available, strategically select moves for optimal effectiveness in battle. Prioritize moves with type advantages.
3.  **Explore Strategy at Coordinate (4,7):** Further examine location at coordinate 4,7 given the new decision to use Tackle with a Pidgey at level 12 with HP of 31/33 against Caterpie.
