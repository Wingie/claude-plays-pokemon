# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Based on the "recent" timeframe)

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Route 1 (Likely, based on wild Pidgey encounters and proximity to Pallet Town)
*   **Primary Pokémon:** Charmander (Presumed, based on "Charmander used Scratch")
*   **Objective:** Reach Viridian City and locate the PokéMart with the blue roof.

## Recent Actions

*   **Navigation:** Attempted to head north from Pallet Town/Route 1 towards Viridian City.
*   **Obstacle:** Encountered a fence blocking the direct northward path from the starting location (position 4,0). Shifted strategy to explore alternative routes (attempting to go right, then up).
*   **Wild Encounters:** Engaged in multiple battles with wild Pidgey on Route 1. Focused on winning these battles for experience.
*   **Combat Tactic:** Primarily used the "Scratch" attack with Charmander.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Path Blockage:**  A fence prevents direct northward progress from the initial location. Navigational detours are required.
*   **Wild Pidgey Encounters:** Route 1 is populated by Pidgey. These encounters provide opportunities for experience gain, but also impede travel.
*   **Charmander's Offense:** The move "Scratch" is being employed for offense, and based on the fact the bot is pressing "A" we can infer the move is effective enough to win the battles.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Navigate Around Obstacle:** Overcome the fence obstacle by exploring alternate routes to the right or upward.
2.  **Reach Viridian City:** Continue traveling north along Route 1, bypassing obstacles until Viridian City is reached.
3.  **Locate PokéMart:** Once in Viridian City, search for the PokéMart with the blue roof.
4.  **Resource Management:** Given the frequency of Pidgey encounters, consider the need for healing items or strategies to minimize health loss between PokéCenters.
