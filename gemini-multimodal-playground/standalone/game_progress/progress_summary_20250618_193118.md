# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up Pikachu through battles.

## Current Status

Currently engaged in battles with wild Caterpie. The battle menu is not yet visible.

## Recent Actions

Over the last ten turns, we have encountered repeated wild Caterpie battles. Each turn has consistently involved the following:

*   **Encountered:** A wild Caterpie.
*   **Observed:** The introductory battle screen, confirming the Caterpie and HP bar visibility, but without the battle menu options ("FIGHT", "BAG", "POKEMON", "RUN").
*   **Action:** Repeatedly pressed the 'A' button to advance through the introductory dialog in each battle. The expected outcome is to reach the battle menu screen.

**Summary:** We've pressed 'A' repeatedly to progress through the battle start screen. The battle menu has not appeared yet.

## Key Discoveries

*   **High Caterpie Encounter Rate:** Caterpie appear to be a very common wild Pokémon in the current area.
*   **Initial Battle Screen Behavior:** The initial battle screen requires repeated button presses to advance past the introductory text and reveal the battle menu.

## Challenges

*   **Progress Delay:** The repeated introductory screens of each battle prevent us from actively engaging in combat. We are stuck in the dialogue advancement phase.
*   **Repetitive Encounters:** The high frequency of Caterpie encounters, while good for potential leveling, is time-consuming when we are stuck at the beginning of each battle.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Troubleshoot Battle Menu Visibility:** Continue pressing 'A' and monitor for any change in the battle state. If the battle menu does not appear after additional button presses, explore alternative solutions for advancing the dialogue.
2.  **Once the Battle Menu appears: Fight the caterpie!**
3.  **Monitor Pikachu's Level:** Keep track of Pikachu's experience points and level to determine progress towards the leveling goal.
