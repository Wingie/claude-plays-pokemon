# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find and win Pokémon battles.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, coordinates (7, 5).
*   **Condition:**  `needs_healing = true`. Party is depleted. Current HP is 20/26, which is below 30% of max HP. Stuck in a loop after losing a battle.

## Recent Actions (Turns 90-99)

The recent turns have been characterized by being stuck in a loop.  The game state reports:

*   Repeatedly encountering the "Huh? I ran out of POKéMON!" message.
*   Remaining at coordinates (7, 5).
*   Acknowledging the need for healing.
*   Planning to advance the text, go to the Pokémon Center and move out of the grass by going down.
*   Repeatedly failing to execute that plan and getting stuck with the same message.

In essence, the bot is stuck at the location after a loss, unable to move or take any actions beyond acknowledging the error state. It is important to note that the repeated messages suggest the agent is stuck in the same state, and not progressing toward the intended goals.

## Key Discoveries

*   **The "Ran out of Pokémon" Loop:** The primary discovery is the existence of a loop the agent gets stuck in when all Pokémon faint.
*   **Low HP Threshold:** Confirmed the HP threshold for `needs_healing` to be when HP is less than 30% of the max value.
*   **Map Dependency:** The agent relies on the map to navigate back to the Pokemon Center from the grassy area.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Break the Loop:** The immediate priority is to break free from the current loop. This might require a different approach to advance text. Perhaps there is some waiting for the text, some sort of key sequence, or other nuance.
2.  **Navigate to Pokémon Center:** Once freed from the loop, immediately navigate to the nearest Pokémon Center to heal the party. The previously mentioned plan of moving out of the grass and heading downwards is sensible.
3.  **Re-evaluate Battle Strategy:** After healing, re-evaluate the battle strategy.  Why did all Pokémon faint? Consider:
    *   Leveling up existing Pokémon in easier areas.
    *   Capturing new Pokémon to expand the team.
    *   Improving move selection and type matchups during battles.
4.  **Improve State Machine:** The agent's state machine must be improved to handle the situation where all Pokemon faint without getting stuck in a loop. Specifically the text advancement may require more advanced techniques.
5.  **Error Handling:** Implement better error handling for game over situations to prevent being stuck and automate the healing process.
