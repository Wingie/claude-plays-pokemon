# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Find battles to win and learn how to fight.

## Current Status

We are currently engaged in a battle where our Pidgey has repeatedly fainted. Our Charmander is available as a backup. We are still struggling to secure victories and effectively learn battle strategies.

## Recent Actions (Turns 85-94)

*   **Repeated Attempts to Switch to Charmander:** After Pidgey fainted in battle, the player consistently selected Charmander (with full HP) from the Pokémon selection screen.
*   **Primary Action:** Responding to the prompt to choose a Pokémon after Pidgey faints. The player always chooses Charmander.
*   **Confirmation of Charmander's Status:** Repeatedly noted that Charmander is at the top of the list and has full HP (29/29).

## Key Discoveries

*   **Pidgey's Ineffectiveness:** Pidgey is currently unable to withstand the opponent's attacks and faints quickly. This suggests Pidgey is under-leveled or faces unfavorable type matchups.
*   **Charmander as a Backup:** The player is reliant on Charmander as a secondary Pokémon when Pidgey is defeated.
*   **Limited Tactical Understanding:** The player has not yet demonstrated an understanding of type matchups, move selection, or other strategic elements of combat. The primary action seems to be simply switching to the next available Pokémon.

## Next Objectives

*   **Develop a Battle Strategy:** Focus on learning type matchups to gain an advantage in battle.
*   **Level Up Charmander:** Prioritize leveling up Charmander to increase its stats and potentially learn new moves. Charmander seems to be the only Pokémon consistently able to battle.
*   **Avoid Relying on Pidgey:** Pidgey is currently too weak to contribute effectively. Explore options for healing or using Pidgey strategically, or consider replacing Pidgey if possible.
*   **Identify Opponent:** Figure out what Pokemon type is defeating Pidgey so quickly.
*   **Move Selection:** Once in battle, begin experimenting with different moves.

## Challenges

*   **Difficulty Winning Battles:** The player is struggling to win battles, indicating a lack of understanding of fundamental gameplay mechanics.
*   **Pidgey's Weakness:** Pidgey's constant fainting is hindering progress and requiring the player to rely solely on Charmander.
*   **Resource Management:** We have no information on the availability of Potions, or other items that could help heal our pokemon.

## Conclusion

While the player is making progress in navigating the battle selection screen, significant improvements are needed in understanding battle strategy and Pokémon management. The focus should shift towards developing a more effective approach to combat and strengthening the available Pokémon.
