# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest.
*   **Coordinates:** (4, 7)
*   **Party Condition:** Pidgey is at full health and has leveled up recently.
*   **Encounter Status:** Not currently in battle.

## Recent Actions & Analysis (Turns 15-24)

*   **Turns 15-18:** Initially stuck in a battle loop against Kakuna. The agent lacked move information and defaulted to using the first available move.
*   **Turns 19-22:** Escaped the battle loop and detected Overworld coordinates (4, 7).  Identified a potential movement loop and the need to re-engage in wild battles to search for a Pikachu. The agent recognized that the Pidgey was at full health due to leveling up.
*   **Turn 23:** Attempted to step down into tall grass to trigger a battle (unsuccessful).
*   **Turn 24:** Confirmed coordinates and realized the current location is *not* in tall grass (tall grass is to the north).  Adjusted the strategy to move north.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Location:** Confirmed to be in Viridian Forest.
*   **Map Awareness:** Agent is able to use map information to guide its movement in the correct directions.
*   **Overworld/Battle Detection:** Successfully transitioning between battle and overworld states.
*   **Coordinate Awareness:** Gained the ability to identify and use coordinates to track position.
*   **Issue:** Suffered from an initial lack of move knowledge, leading to repeated attacking without strategic advantage in Kakuna battles.
*   **Issue:** Experienced difficulty consistently entering the tall grass area.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Navigate to Tall Grass:** Move three steps north from current location (4,7) to enter the tall grass area.
2.  **Trigger Wild Encounters:** Once in the tall grass, move randomly to increase the chance of encountering wild Pokémon.
3.  **Identify and Capture Pikachu:** Prioritize Pikachu encounters. Upon encountering Pikachu, attempt to capture it (details on capture strategy to be determined later).
4.  **Gather Move Information:** Begin gathering information about the available moves for our Pokémon and type matchups to improve battle strategy.
