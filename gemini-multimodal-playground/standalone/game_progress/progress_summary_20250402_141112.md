# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Goal:** Explore Viridian Forest and catch a Pikachu.

## I. Current Status

*   **Location:** Viridian Forest (in tall grass)
*   **Objective Status:** Initial exploration of Viridian Forest has begun. No Pikachu encountered yet.
*   **Challenges:** Difficulty navigating from the Pokemon Center to Viridian Forest. Course correction was frequently needed.

## II. Recent Actions (Turns 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14)

1.  **Exiting the Pokémon Center (Turns 5-9):**  Initial attempts to leave the Viridian City Pokémon Center proved challenging. The command sequence Down, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right was intended to exit and head toward the forest. Repetitive actions suggest difficulty in navigation.
2.  **Navigating to Viridian Forest (Turns 10-13):** After exiting the Pokemon Center and reaching Route 2, further course correction was necessary to align with the Viridian Forest entrance. Repeated attempts to approach the tall grass were made. Actions were corrected by moving `Up`.
3.  **Entering Viridian Forest (Turn 14):** After several turns of course correction, finally entered the tall grass of Viridian Forest. A sequence of random movements (Right, Up, Left) was initiated to trigger a wild encounter.

## III. Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Navigation Challenges:**  Navigating even short distances from the Pokémon Center to the Forest proved unexpectedly difficult, requiring multiple course corrections. This suggests a need for more precise movement commands or a better understanding of the game's coordinate system.
*   **Encounter Triggering:**  The strategy to trigger wild encounters involves random movements within tall grass. This is a standard mechanic of the game but may not be the most efficient method for finding a specific Pokémon like Pikachu.
*   **Location Tracking:** Initial turns displayed an unknown current location. Later turns helped establish the character's location relative to key areas like Viridian City PC and Viridian Forest.

## IV. Next Objectives

1.  **Initiate Encounters:** Continue moving randomly within Viridian Forest to trigger wild Pokémon encounters.
2.  **Identify & Catch Pikachu:**  Once an encounter begins, identify the opponent Pokémon. If it's Pikachu, attempt to catch it using Poké Balls.
3.  **Optimize Encounter Strategy:** If Pikachu remains elusive, explore alternative strategies for increasing encounter rates (e.g., using Repels to avoid weaker Pokémon, understanding spawn rates in different areas of the forest).
4.  **Document Encounter Data:**  Begin documenting encounter types and frequencies to better understand Pokémon distribution within Viridian Forest. This data could inform a more targeted search for Pikachu.
