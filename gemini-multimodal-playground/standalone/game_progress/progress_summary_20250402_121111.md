# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Level up Mankey through battles.

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Overworld, Tall Grass (Specific location relative to landmarks: Below a ledge)
*   **Active Pokémon:** Mankey (Target for growth)
*   **Status Summary:** Repeatedly engaging in battles within the tall grass to gain experience for Mankey.

## Recent Actions (Turns 60-69)

*   **Turn 60-61:** Strategically positioned in the tall grass below a ledge to maximize Pokémon encounter rate.
*   **Turns 62-69:** Initiated and engaged in a series of battles against Wild Pidgey.  Consistently used the first attack option (assumed to be the strongest) in each battle.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Enemy Encounter:** Wild Pidgey are frequently encountered in the current location.
*   **Attack Strategy:** Using the first attack option consistently.

## Challenges

*   **Repetitive Battles:** Encountering the same Pokémon (Pidgey) repeatedly. This might indicate a need to explore different areas for a more diverse range of opponents and faster leveling.
*   **Unspecified Attack Type:** The report does not specify the type of attack being used. This makes it impossible to determine the attack's effectiveness against Pidgey.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Continue Grinding:** Persist with battling Pidgey in the current location to level up Mankey.
2.  **Evaluate Attack Effectiveness:** Determine the type of the first attack option and whether it is optimal for defeating Pidgey. If not, consider switching to a more effective move (if available).
3.  **Monitor Mankey's Level:** Track Mankey's level progress. If the leveling process becomes too slow due to low experience yield from Pidgey, explore alternative locations.
4.  **Explore Alternative Locations:** If Pidgey battles are proving inefficient, scout nearby areas for potentially stronger and more diverse Pokémon encounters. Moving further from starting locations could provide greater opportunities to improve Mankey's stats in battles.
