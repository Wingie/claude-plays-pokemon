# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Engaged in a series of battles with wild Weedle.
*   Primary focus: Leveling up the Mankey.
*   Currently in an ongoing battle sequence.

**Recent Actions:**

*   Navigated through screen transitions (initial black screen).
*   Repeatedly selected "FIGHT" and "SCRATCH" in battles against Weedle.
*   Consistently chosen the first attack option ("SCRATCH").

**Key Discoveries:**

*   Encountering frequent Weedle battles.
*   "FIGHT" option is often pre-selected at the start of battle turns.
*   "SCRATCH" is the primary, readily available attack for Mankey.
*   The game seems to automatically highlight the first attack option.

**Challenges:**

*   Repetitive nature of battles against Weedle (potential for slow progress).
*   No indication of battle outcomes (win/loss, experience gained).
*   Lack of variety in enemy Pokémon encountered.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  Continue battling Weedle (or other available Pokémon) to level up Mankey.
2.  Monitor Mankey's stats and level to determine when to move to a new area for more challenging encounters.
3.  Identify and explore new routes or areas to diversify battle opponents.
4.  Track battle outcomes (wins/losses, experience gained) to gauge progress more accurately.
5. Consider exploring options beyond "SCRATCH" once they become available (level up, TMs, etc.)

**Strategic Considerations:**

*   **Optimization:** While "SCRATCH" is readily available, consider whether it's the most effective attack long-term. Compare damage output as Mankey levels up.
*   **Resource Management:** No items or status conditions have been reported yet, but keep an eye on Mankey's health to avoid faints.
*   **Exploration:** Once Mankey reaches a suitable level, prioritize exploring new areas for better training opportunities.
