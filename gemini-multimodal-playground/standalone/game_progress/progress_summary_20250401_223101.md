# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Current Status:**

*   Currently navigating towards Viridian City.
*   Encountered obstacles blocking direct northern progress.
*   Aiming to reach the Viridian City Pokémart (identified by its blue roof).

**Recent Actions (Turns 13-30):**

*   **Initial Navigation Attempts (Turns 13-15, 19):** Repeatedly attempted to move north, initially encountering wild Rattata, then gaining EXP. We can infer Charmander was engaged in battle, likely winning, contributing to experience gains.
*   **Obstacle Encountered (Turns 21, 23, 27-30):** A ledge is blocking direct northward movement. The player identified that going left is necessary to circumvent this obstacle. Repeatedly moving left in an attempt to bypass the ledge and a person standing in the way.

**Key Discoveries & Challenges:**

*   **Ledge Obstacle:** The primary challenge is navigating around a ledge that prevents direct northern progress.
*   **NPC Obstruction:** An NPC is partially blocking the path around the ledge, further complicating navigation.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Circumnavigate the Ledge:** Continue moving left until clear of the ledge and the NPC.
2.  **Resume Northward Travel:** After clearing the obstacle, resume moving north towards Viridian City.
3.  **Locate the Pokémart:** Once in Viridian City, identify and reach the Pokémart with the blue roof.
