# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen - Viridian Forest Exploration Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Status:**

*   Location: Viridian Forest
*   Objective: Find and catch a Pikachu
*   Recent Progress: Entered Viridian Forest and engaging in battles to level up.
*   Lead Pokémon HP: 29/29
*   Needs Healing: No
*   In Tall Grass: Yes

**Recent Actions (Turns 0-4, 18-22):**

The primary focus has been navigating Viridian Forest and battling wild Pokémon, primarily Weedles and a Caterpie.

*   **Initial Exploration (Turn 2):**  After several initial turns of dealing with battle result screens, we established our initial position at coordinates (6, 11) outside the tall grass.
*   **Engaging Wild Pokémon:**  The strategy involves moving into the tall grass to trigger encounters and battling the wild Pokémon to gain experience.
*   **Recurring Battles:**  The majority of recent battles have been against Weedles. One Caterpie was also encountered (Turn 4). The selected strategy has been to consistently choose the "Fight" option and default to the first move, indicating limited move options or knowledge.
*   **Post-Battle Navigation (Turns 18-22):**  A loop has been identified where, after a battle concludes, we return to the overworld and repeat the same action of moving randomly in the tall grass (Down, Left, Right, sometimes Up, Right, Up). This loop needs to be addressed to ensure more efficient exploration.

**Key Discoveries:**

*   **Dominance of Bug Pokémon:** Weedle is appearing very frequently in Viridian Forest.
*   **Confirmed Viridian Forest Location:** Game memory confirms the current location as "Viridian Forest".
*   **Battle Progression:** Actions to continue after a battle by pressing 'A' have been successfully implemented.
*   **Caterpie Sighting:** A Caterpie was encountered, showing more species diversity than just Weedle.

**Challenges Faced:**

*   **Battle Result Screen Loop:** The agent initially got stuck repeating the action to advance past the battle result screen.
*   **Navigation Loop:** An identified loop occurs after battles where the same random movement pattern is repeated, hindering efficient exploration. This movement pattern should be varied or made more strategic.
*   **Pikachu Elusiveness:** A Pikachu has not yet been encountered.
*   **Limited Move Variety:** The consistent reliance on the first move suggests limited options or knowledge. Improving move selection could enhance battle efficiency.

**Next Objectives:**

1.  **Break the Navigation Loop:** Implement a more varied or strategic movement pattern within the tall grass to avoid repeating the same steps after each battle. This will improve the chances of finding different Pokémon and covering more ground.
2.  **Continue Searching for Pikachu:** Focus on exploring different areas within Viridian Forest, rather than remaining in a small area.
3.  **Improve Battle Efficiency:** Investigate and utilize different moves during battles to maximize efficiency and potentially discover weaknesses of opponents.
4.  **Monitor Lead Pokémon HP:** While currently full, actively track HP to anticipate when healing at the Pokémon Center becomes necessary.
5. **Catch a Pokemon** Catch a pokemon so we have more than 1 for our party.
