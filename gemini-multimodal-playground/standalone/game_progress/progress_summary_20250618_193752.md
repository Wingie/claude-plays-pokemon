# Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Current Goal:** Find battles to level up Pikachu

## Current Status

*   **Location:** Currently stuck in a battle loop.
*   **Party:** Pikachu (HP: 14/20).
*   **Condition:** Pikachu needs healing (HP < 30%).
*   **Status:** Experiencing a bug where the game remains in the move selection screen after defeating a Wild CATERPIE.

## Recent Actions (Turns 70-79)

*   Repeatedly attempted to exit the battle by pressing the "A" button.
*   Analyzed the game state in each turn, confirming the presence of the bug.
*   Identified that Pikachu needs healing after the battle.
*   Confirmed that our Pikachu has access to the attacks GROWL, THUNDERSHOCK and TAIL WHIP.

## Key Discoveries

*   **Bug Encounter:** The game is experiencing a bug where it gets stuck on the move selection screen after defeating a CATERPIE.
*   **Pikachu's Condition:** Pikachu's health is low and requires healing as soon as the battle bug is resolved.
*   **Inability to Progress:** The bug is currently preventing any meaningful progress in the game.

## Next Objectives

1.  **Escape the Battle Loop:** Continue attempting to advance the dialog by pressing "A" in order to exit the battle.
2.  **Heal Pikachu:** Immediately after exiting the battle, prioritize healing Pikachu to avoid further risks.
3.  **Investigate the Bug:** If the loop persists, explore alternative solutions to bypass the bug. (e.g., Reset, try different inputs, etc.)
4.  **Resume Leveling:** Once the bug is resolved, resume the original objective of finding battles to level up Pikachu.

## Narrative Summary

Our progress has been significantly hampered by a game-breaking bug. For the past ten turns, we have been trapped in a battle loop after defeating a wild CATERPIE. Each turn confirms the loop, and we are still unable to exit the battle despite repeated attempts to press the "A" button to advance the dialogue. Pikachu's low health adds an extra layer of urgency to resolving this issue. Our immediate priority is to escape this bug, heal Pikachu, and then resume our goal of leveling up.
