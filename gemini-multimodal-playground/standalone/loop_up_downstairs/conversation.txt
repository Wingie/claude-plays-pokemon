Gemini: Okay, I'm in my house on the first floor (1F). I see my mom near a table with chairs. There are stairs to the left. I need to go up the stairs to look for the professor, so I need to first navigate around the table and chairs, then approach the stairs, and finally press 'a' to go up them.

Here's the plan:
1. Move down, then left, to get around the table.
2. Move up, then left to approach the stairs
3. Then press left to go up the stairs.
