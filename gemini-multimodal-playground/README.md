https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82228033-fcfb-4730-9723-3ed09e1979a2

### Prerequisites
Same as above, but only Python-related requirements are needed and Tkinter:
   - On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
   - On Fedora: `sudo dnf install python3-tkinter`
   - On macOS & Windows: Already included with Python

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the standalone folder

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the standalone directory with your API key:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Running the Standalone Application

1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated
2. Run the script:
```bash
python standalone.py
```

## Configuration Options

Both versions provide several configuration options:

- **System Prompt**: The initial instructions given to Gemini about its role and behavior
- **Input Mode**: Choose your preferred input method:
  - Video (webcam)
  - Screen sharing
- **Voice**: Choose from different voice options for Gemini's responses:
  - Puck
  - Charon
  - Kore
  - Fenrir
  - Aoede
- **Enable Google Search**: Allows Gemini to search the internet for current information
- **Allow Interruptions**: Enables interrupting Gemini while it's speaking

## Troubleshooting

- **Audio feedback loop issue** - Gemini may interrupt itself when it detects its own voice output through your microphone. This occurs because the application processes all incoming audio, including Gemini's responses. To prevent this feedback loop, either:
  1. Disable the "Allow Interruptions" option in settings
  2. Use headphones/earphones to prevent your microphone from picking up Gemini's audio output
