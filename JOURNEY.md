**Navigation Testing:**
- Memory clearing for fresh navigation tests
- Route confidence scoring and success tracking
- Visual landmark recognition and similarity matching
- Location history and navigation optimization

### Phase 4: Core Game Loop Implementation ðŸš§
**Timeline**: Current development  
**Status**: In Progress

**Target Achievements:**
- ðŸš§ Continuous screenshot â†’ AI analysis â†’ button press â†’ memory update loop
- ðŸš§ Real-time logging system for `tail -f` monitoring
- ðŸš§ Integration of `run_step_gemini.py` game loop pattern into interactive system
- ðŸš§ Auto-resume functionality with `--continue` flag
- ðŸš§ Enhanced EeveeAgent methods for interruptible execution
- ðŸš§ Gemini tool calling for button press sequences

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Continuous Game Loop Function**: Core pattern from `run_step_gemini.py`
   - Screenshot capture every 1-2 seconds
   - Gemini API analysis with Pokemon tool calling
   - Button press execution and validation
   - Memory updates and OKR progress tracking

2. **Real-time Logging System**: 
   - `runs/TIMESTAMP_session.log` for live monitoring
   - Screenshot storage in `runs/TIMESTAMP_screenshots/`
   - Memory and route learning logs

3. **Enhanced Interactive Integration**:
   - `/play` command to start autonomous gameplay
   - `--continue` flag for auto-resume from last session
   - Seamless transition between chat and gameplay modes

**Missing Components (Identified from Analysis):**
- Core game loop function (similar to `run_step_gemini.py` lines 148-232)
- Real-time logging infrastructure
- Enhanced `execute_task_interruptible()` method in EeveeAgent
- Integration between continuous play and interactive commands

### Phase 5: Navigation Intelligence Testing ðŸ“‹
**Timeline**: Next phase  
**Status**: Planned

**Goals:**
- Test Claude's ability to find Viridian Forest autonomously
- Verify memory retention: can it remember the route back?
- Navigation intelligence benchmarking
- Route optimization and learning validation
- Visual landmark recognition accuracy

**Success Metrics:**
- Successfully navigate to Viridian Forest from Pokemon Center
- Remember and replicate the route on subsequent attempts
- Build comprehensive location memory and route database
- Demonstrate learning and improvement over multiple runs

## Technical Achievements

3. Add `/play` command for autonomous gameplay
4. Test navigation intelligence with Viridian Forest challenge
5. Optimize memory retention and route learning

## Usage Examples

### Current Working System
```bash
# Interactive mode with all features
python eevee/run_eevee.py --interactive --enable-okr --neo4j-memory

# Single task execution
python eevee/run_eevee.py "check my Pokemon party" --verbose --save-report
```

### Target System (Phase 4 Complete)
```bash
# Auto-resume continuous gameplay
python eevee/run_eevee.py --interactive --enable-okr --continue

# Monitor in real-time
tail -f runs/20250618_143052_session.log

# Navigation intelligence test
# 1. Start: pokemon eevee/run_eevee.py --interactive --enable-okr
# 2. Chat: "Find Viridian Forest and remember the route"
# 3. Monitor: tail -f runs/latest/session.log
# 4. Test: "/reset-memory" then "Navigate to Viridian Forest using memory"
```

This journey represents the evolution from basic task execution to a sophisticated AI gaming system with human-in-the-loop capabilities and advanced memory retention.
